## 1. BRAND FOUNDATION

### **Brand Positioning**

We create documentary-style brand films that people actually want to watch—not because they have to, but because the story matters.

### **What We Do**

Transform corporate messaging into authentic stories using documentary filmmaking techniques and cinema-quality production.

### **What We Don't Do**

- Generic promotional videos
- Event highlight reels (without story)
- Talking-head interview compilations
- Stock-footage explainer videos

### **Competitive Differentiation**

| Others                     | Coalbanks                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Corporate video production | Documentary-style storytelling        |
| Scripts and teleprompters  | Real conversations, authentic moments |
| Fast turnaround            | Thoughtful discovery process          |
| One-size-fits-all packages | Custom story development              |
| Service provider mindset   | Creative partner approach             |

### **Brand Promise**

Films that get watched, shared, and remembered—because they don't sound like marketing.

## 2. VOICE & TONE

### **Our Voice Is:**

✅ **Confident, not cocky**

- We know our craft, but we're here to serve the story
- Direct about our value without over-promising
- Professional without corporate jargon

✅ **Conversational, not casual**

- Write like you're talking to a smart colleague over coffee
- Use contractions (we're, don't, it's)
- Avoid slang, memes, or forced casualness

✅ **Specific, not vague**

- Real numbers and outcomes over abstract benefits
- Concrete examples instead of conceptual descriptions
- "2-3 week post-production" not "quick turnaround"

✅ **Human, not folksy**

- Acknowledge real business challenges
- Speak to emotions without being sentimental
- Authentic without performing authenticity

### **Tone Spectrum by Context**

## 4. WRITING GUIDELINES

### **The 10 Commandments of Coalbanks Copy**

#### **1. Lead with Outcomes, Not Process**

❌ **Don't write:**  
"We use documentary filmmaking techniques to craft your story"

✅ **Write:**  
"Films that get 3x more views because they don't sound like marketing"

---

#### **2. Be Specific, Always**

❌ **Don't write:**  
"Quick turnaround times"

✅ **Write:**  
"4-6 weeks, start to finish"

---

#### **3. Show, Then Tell**

❌ **Don't write:**  
"We create authentic, engaging content"

✅ **Write:**  
"Watch our work. You'll see the difference." [Link to portfolio]

---

#### **4. Use Active Voice**

❌ **Don't write:**  
"Your story will be discovered through our unique process"

✅ **Write:**  
"We dig into your story until we find what matters"

---

#### **5. Write Short Sentences. Then Shorter.**

❌ **Don't write:**  
"Our documentary-style approach, which incorporates cinema-quality production values with authentic storytelling methodologies, ensures that your brand message resonates with your target audience."

✅ **Write:**  
"Documentary storytelling. Cinema cameras. Stories that land."

---

#### **6. Cut the Qualifiers**

❌ **Weak words:**

- "We try to..."
- "We hope to..."
- "We believe we can..."
- "Probably our best..."
- "One of the leading..."

✅ **Strong alternatives:**

- "We do..."
- "We will..."
- "We deliver..."
- "Our best work..."
- "Trusted by..."

---

#### **7. Avoid Marketing Clichés**

❌ **Banned phrases:**

- "Think outside the box"
- "Cutting-edge solutions"
- "Synergy"
- "Value-add"
- "Best-in-class"
- "Leverage"
- "Game-changer"
- "Take it to the next level"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Circle back"

✅ **Use plain language instead**

---

#### **8. Replace Adjectives with Evidence**

❌ **Don't write:**  
"Amazing results"

✅ **Write:**  
"47,000 views and 12 qualified applicants in 3 weeks"

---

#### **9. Answer "So What?" After Every Claim**

**Exercise:**

- Write a feature → Ask "So what?" → Answer with the benefit

**Example:**

- Feature: "We spend 1-2 weeks in discovery"
- So what? → "We find the story worth telling"
- So what? → "Your film doesn't waste viewers' time"
- So what? → "Higher completion rates and better results"

---

#### **10. End with Action**

Every section should end with:

- A clear next step
- A link to more information
- A question that prompts engagement

---

### **Word Choice Guide**

#### **Power Words (Use These)**

- Authentic / Real / Genuine
- Documentary / Cinema / Craft
- Story / Narrative / Truth
- Impact / Results / Outcomes
- Specific / Clear / Direct

#### **Weak Words (Replace These)**

- Solutions → [Be specific: "Brand films" not "video solutions"]
- Innovative → [Show innovation, don't claim it]
- Quality → [Demonstrate with specifics: "Cinema cameras" "Sound mix"]
- Professional → [Expected, not a differentiator]
- Passionate → [Show it through work, don't say it]

<a name="conversion-principles"></a>

## 6. CONVERSION PRINCIPLES

### **The Conversion Hierarchy**

Every page should follow this structure:

text

```
1. GRAB ATTENTION
   ↓ (Compelling headline + visual)

2. CALL OUT THE PROBLEM
   ↓ (Name their pain/challenge)

3. PRESENT THE SOLUTION
   ↓ (Your unique approach)

4. PROVE IT WORKS
   ↓ (Testimonials, outcomes, examples)

5. EXPLAIN THE PROCESS
   ↓ (Remove uncertainty)

6. HANDLE OBJECTIONS
   ↓ (Price, time, risk, quality)

7. CLEAR NEXT STEP
   ↓ (One primary CTA)
```

---

### **Conversion Copywriting Rules**

#### **Rule 1: One Page, One Goal**

Every page should have a single primary conversion goal:

- **Homepage:** Watch demo reel → Portfolio
- **Portfolio:** Book discovery call
- **Case Study:** Start a project / Get proposal
- **Blog Post:** Subscribe / Read related case study
- **Pricing:** Request custom quote

#### **Rule 2: Features → Benefits → Outcomes**

Always complete the chain:

text

```
FEATURE (What it is)
   ↓
BENEFIT (What it means)
   ↓
OUTCOME (What they get)

Example:
✗ "We use cinema cameras" (Feature only)
✓ "Cinema cameras → Broadcast-quality visuals →
   Films that look premium, not amateur" (Full chain)
```

#### **Rule 3: Proof Over Claims**

Replace every claim with evidence:

| Claim               | Proof                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| "High-quality work" | "Shot on RED Komodo, color graded by [Name]" |
| "Fast delivery"     | "Delivered in 4-6 weeks"                     |
| "Great results"     | "12 qualified applicants in 3 weeks"         |
| "Experienced team"  | "65+ films since 2019"                       |

#### **Rule 4: Reduce Friction**

Every extra field in a form = 10% fewer conversions

**Lead Capture Forms:**

- Discovery call: Name, Email, Phone (3 fields max)
- Proposal request: +Company, +Project Type (5 fields max)
- Newsletter: Email only (1 field)

**Remove:**

- Subject lines
- Dropdown menus with 20+ options
- Required fields that aren't essential
- CAPTCHAs (use honeypot instead)

#### **Rule 5: Social Proof Hierarchy**

Not all testimonials are equal. Use this priority:

text

```
TIER 1 (Most Valuable)
→ Specific outcomes with numbers
   "Got us 12 applications in 3 weeks"

TIER 2
→ Emotional impact with attribution
   "Our employees actually shared it" - Name, Title, Company

TIER 3
→ Process praise
   "They really understood our story"

TIER 4 (Least Valuable)
→ Generic praise
   "Great to work with!" (Don't use these)
```

---

Before publishing any page, verify:

- [ ]  Clear headline that states benefit (not feature)

### **Common Scenarios: WWCD (What Would Coalbanks Do)?**

#### **Scenario 1: Client wants "viral" social media content**

❌ **Don't say:** "We don't do that kind of work."

✅ **Do say:** "We can definitely create content optimized for social sharing. Our approach is to find the authentic story that people *want* to share, rather than chase trends. Let me show you some examples of our work that got organic reach..."

---

#### **Scenario 2: Competitor claims they're faster/cheaper**

❌ **Don't say:** "We're worth the extra cost."

✅ **Do say:** "Our 4-6 week timeline includes 1-2 weeks of discovery to find the real story. That's what separates a film people watch from one they skip. Happy to show you the difference in results."

---

#### **Scenario 3: Client asks "Can you make it more corporate/polished?"**

❌ **Don't say:** "That defeats the purpose of documentary style."

✅ **Do say:** "Absolutely—we can adjust the tone. What specifically do you mean by 'more corporate'? Is it the pacing, the voiceover style, or the visual treatment? Our goal is professional polish with authentic storytelling, but we can dial up the formality if that serves your audience better."

---

#### **Scenario 4: Prospect says "We'll just do it ourselves on iPhone"**

❌ **Don't say:** "Good luck with that."

✅ **Do say:** "That can definitely work for some content—especially social media BTS. Where we add value is in the story development, interview techniques, and post-production that makes the difference between a video and a film. If you're considering DIY for some stuff and pro for your flagship piece, that's a smart approach."

## 10. QUICK REFERENCE

### **The Coalbanks Writing Checklist**

Print this and keep it by your desk:

text

```
Before you hit publish, ask:

□ Does the headline promise an outcome (not describe a feature)?
□ Can a 12-year-old understand it?
□ Is there specific proof (numbers, examples)?
□ Is the CTA crystal clear?
□ Would I skip past this?
□ Does it sound like a real person wrote it?
□ Is there an unnecessary word I can cut?
□ Have I answered "so what?"
□ Is the next step obvious?
□ Would our ideal client feel understood?
```
