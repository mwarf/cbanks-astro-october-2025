_An honest conversation about AI tools in documentary-style video production._

---

Here's a conversation we've been having more often with clients:

**"Do you use AI?"**

The short answer: Yes, selectively.

The honest answer: It's complicated—and we think you deserve the full picture.

AI has become the most polarizing topic in video production. Some agencies promote it as a revolution. Others ban it entirely. The internet is full of hot takes from both camps.

We're not interested in hot takes. We're interested in making films that actually work for your business.

So let's talk about what AI actually does in our workflow, what it doesn't do, and why authentic storytelling still requires a human at the wheel.

## The Parts Nobody Sees: Where AI Actually Helps

Most of our AI use is invisible. It handles the tedious technical work so our artists can focus on storytelling.

### Rotoscoping and Masking

Remember when we said professional editing takes 50-60 hours? A significant chunk of that used to be rotoscoping—manually tracing around subjects frame by frame to separate them from backgrounds.

Now, AI tools can generate initial masks in seconds. But here's the key: **the AI gives us a starting point, not a finished product.** Our editors still refine every edge, correct errors, and make creative decisions about how elements composite together.

**Before AI:** 4 hours cutting out a person from a complex background.
**After AI:** 30 minutes refining what the AI started.

We didn't replace the artist. We eliminated the most robotic part of their job.

### Noise Reduction and Audio Cleanup

We film in manufacturing facilities at 92 decibels. We record in agricultural settings where a tractor starts up mid-interview. These environments don't pause for clean audio.

AI-powered noise reduction (tools like iZotope RX) helps us rescue dialogue that would have been unusable ten years ago. The forklift beeping behind your machinist? Reduced by 80%. The HVAC hum in your conference room? Gone.

**This isn't magic—it's math.** The AI identifies and isolates specific frequency patterns. But the decisions about how aggressively to apply it, what frequencies define your voice versus background noise, how to balance clarity against natural sound—that's still our audio engineer.

### Upscaling and Restoration

Sometimes we receive archival footage from clients—legacy videos shot in SD, old VHS transfers, footage that needs to be part of a modern project.

AI upscaling can enhance resolution and reduce artifacts. We use this to preserve your history, not replace it.

## What AI Can't Do (And Why It Matters)

Here's what the AI hype cycle gets wrong: **AI can generate pixels. It can't generate meaning.**

### AI Can't Listen to Your Story

Our discovery process takes 1-2 weeks. We sit with your leadership, interview your employees, understand your challenges. We ask questions like "What do you wish people understood about welding?" and listen for 20 minutes while a 28-year veteran explains the difference between good welders and great ones.

AI can't do that. There's no prompt for "understand this company's soul."

The stories that make people care—the ones that drive 73% completion rates and 23 job applications from a single video—emerge from human conversation. They emerge from listening.

### AI Can't Direct a Room

When we film in a loud factory, we're managing safety protocols, coordinating with floor supervisors, putting nervous employees at ease, and making a hundred micro-decisions about timing and positioning.

We're reading body language. We're noticing that the machinist is more relaxed when talking about his apprentices than when talking about equipment. We're adjusting our questions in real-time.

AI generates from prompts. Documentary filmmaking responds to reality.

### AI Can't Edit for Emotion

Our edits are built on pacing, tension, and release. We slow down at the moment a veteran employee's voice catches when describing what the job means to them. We cut away just before the emotion becomes uncomfortable.

These aren't algorithmic decisions. They're the result of understanding how stories work, how human attention moves, and how to create meaning from raw footage.

**AI is very good at pattern matching. It's very bad at judgment.**

## The Ethical Lines We Draw

We've watched the industry stumble into some ugly situations with AI. We've learned from their mistakes.

### We Don't Replace Humans with Generated Faces

Toys "R" Us released an AI-generated commercial with a morphing child and dead-eyed characters. It was called "nightmare fuel."

We film real people. When you watch a Coalbanks video, every face you see belongs to someone who chose to be there, who shared their story, who represents your company authentically.

AI-generated faces don't have stories. They're pixels without history. Your employees and customers have both.

### We Don't Use AI to Fake Diversity

Levi's tried to use AI-generated models to "increase diversity" on their e-commerce site. The backlash was immediate and deserved.

If your team is diverse, we show your team. If you're working on building a more inclusive culture, we tell that story honestly. We don't manufacture representation—we document it.

### We're Transparent About What We Use

If AI tools contributed significantly to a project, we'll tell you. Not because we're legally required to (the law is still catching up), but because transparency is how trust works.

We want you to know what you're getting. No hidden ingredients.

## The "Real Creative" Question

Here's the criticism AI users get: "You're not real creatives. You just type prompts."

For some AI workflows, that's fair. But that's not how we work.

Our projects involve:
- 15-20 hours of discovery and planning
- 2-3 days of professional filming with real equipment and real crews
- 50-60 hours of editing, color grading, and sound design
- Multiple rounds of revision based on human feedback

AI touches maybe 10% of that workflow—and only the technical portions.

**The creative decisions? Those are ours.** The narrative structure, the interview questions, the emotional pacing, the color palette, the music selection, the moments we choose to linger on—that's 65+ films of experience, not a prompt.

## Why This Matters for Southern Alberta

The AI debate plays out differently in different markets.

In LA or New York, agencies compete on cutting-edge technology. "We use AI!" is a selling point.

Here, relationships matter more than tech specs. You're hiring people, not platforms.

When a Lethbridge manufacturer needs a recruitment video, they need someone who understands what a third-shift handoff looks like, why experienced welders take pride in their craft, and how to tell that story to candidates who might not otherwise consider the trades.

No AI model has spent time on Alberta factory floors. No algorithm understands Southern Alberta's culture of practical problem-solving and straightforward communication.

We do.

## Our Position

**AI is a tool.** Like color grading software. Like audio mixing hardware. Like the cameras we use.

Tools don't make films. People make films with tools.

We use AI when it eliminates tedious work without compromising human judgment. We don't use it when it would replace the elements that make our work matter—the listening, the directing, the editing for emotion, the human connection.

**The best videos aren't made by prompts. They're made by people who care enough to do the hard work of understanding your story.**

That's what we do.
