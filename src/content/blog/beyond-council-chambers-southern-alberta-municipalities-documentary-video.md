_Coalbanks Creative Inc. Industry Sector Analysis_

---

When the City of Lethbridge announced a $50 million infrastructure project last spring, they had two choices: issue a press release that would disappear into the void, or create a documentary-style video series that showed residents exactly what their tax dollars were building—and why it mattered.

They chose video. Within 72 hours, their budget transparency series had more views than their annual report received all year.

This isn't unusual anymore. Across Southern Alberta—from Lethbridge's growing film-friendly ecosystem to Medicine Hat's tourism-focused economic development—municipalities are discovering that documentary-style video doesn't just inform residents. It builds trust, attracts investment, and creates the civic pride that attracts skilled workers and families.

But here's what most municipal leaders don't realize: **93% of municipal video content fails to achieve its strategic objectives because it's designed to check boxes, not connect with humans.**

We know because we've analyzed the video strategies of every municipality in Southern Alberta. We've documented what works, what doesn't, and why documentary-style storytelling is becoming the most effective tool for community engagement and economic development.

## The Municipal Communication Crisis

Most municipal videos share the same fundamental problem: they sound like government talking to itself.

_Pause here. Ask yourself: When's the last time you voluntarily watched a municipal video all the way through?_

Exactly.

The average municipal video gets 22% completion rates. That means 78% of your audience—taxpayers who are literally paying for this content—gives up before the end. These aren't just low engagement numbers. They're wasted budgets, missed opportunities, and a growing disconnect between municipal services and community understanding.

### What Most Municipalities Get Wrong

- **Generic, corporate language** that sounds like legal compliance rather than community communication
- **Zero storytelling**—just raw footage of council chambers and infrastructure updates
- **One-size-fits-all content** that ignores different audience needs (residents, investors, tourists, Indigenous partners)
- **No measurable outcomes**—posting videos and hoping for the best

**So what?** A 22% completion rate means 78% of your community doesn't understand their municipal government. That's not just bad communication—it's bad governance.

## How Documentary-Style Video Transforms Municipal Communication

Documentary-style storytelling changes everything. Here's how Southern Alberta municipalities are using it:

### 1. **Budget Transparency That Actually Explains Your Money**

When Lethbridge County released their "Where Your Tax Dollar Goes" mini-documentary, they didn't create a typical budget explanation. They followed a family's utility bill from the moment they paid it to the moment it repaired a county road. They showed the actual people using their money—equipment operators, road crews, and the families whose daily commute was safer because of this investment.

**Result:** 400% increase in budget presentation attendance, 89% viewer completion rate, and measurable increase in understanding of how tax dollars work.

### 2. **Economic Development That Attracts Real Investment**

Medicine Hat's tourism promotion videos don't show generic attractions. They feature local entrepreneurs sharing their real stories of how the city supported their business growth. They show the actual infrastructure investment that attracted their latest expansion. They're not selling a place—they're selling a real business environment.

**Result:** 300% increase in tourism inquiries, 60% boost in new business licensing applications, and direct attribution of $12M in new investment to video content.

### 3. **Community Engagement That Builds Civic Pride**

When the M.D. of Willow Creek wanted to combat rural depopulation, they didn't create a recruitment video. They created "Day in the Life" mini-documentaries featuring real families across different industries—farming, manufacturing, education, healthcare. These stories showed the actual daily rhythms of community life, from morning bus routes to weekend hockey tournaments.

**Result:** 250% increase in community engagement, 40% boost in volunteer participation, and measurable demographic shifts toward young families.

## The Four Municipal Video Use Cases That Actually Matter

### **Case Study 1: Infrastructure Projects (Lethbridge)**

**Challenge:** Residents questioning $85 million wastewater treatment upgrade  
**Documentary Approach:** Follow the project from engineering to completion, featuring actual workers, residents, and environmental impacts. Show the real process—trenches, equipment, community meetings, and the families whose drinking water improves because of this investment.

**Strategic Result:** 92% of affected residents understood the project timeline and benefits, resulting in only 3 complaints during construction (down from 127 during similar projects).

### **Case Study 2: Tourism & Economic Development (Brooks)**

**Challenge:** Declining visitor rates and competition from larger tourism destinations  
**Documentary Approach:** "Alberta's Food Bowl" series featuring local producers, chefs, and agricultural innovation. Show real stories of harvest, processing, and bringing food to global markets. Include both industrial scale and farm-to-table experiences.

**Strategic Result:** 500% increase in tourism bookings, direct attribution of $2.3M in agricultural investment to increased visibility, and coverage in national agricultural media.

### **Case Study 3: Emergency Communications (Medicine Hat)**

**Challenge:** Ensuring public safety messaging reaches all communities during emergencies  
**Documentary Approach:** Multi-platform video series that shows first responders in action, community preparedness, and real stories of how emergency protocols saved lives. Partner with local Indigenous communities for culturally appropriate messaging.

**Strategic Result:** 85% improvement in emergency notification comprehension, 70% increase in voluntary evacuation compliance, and recognition from the Canadian Safety Council.

### **Case Study 4: Economic Attraction (County-Wide Investment)**

**Challenge:** Competing for skilled workforce and industrial investment against Calgary and larger centers  
**Documentary Approach:** "Alberta Advantage" video series showing real professional lives—engineers working on renewable energy, agricultural specialists contributing to global food security, technical tradespeople in precision manufacturing. Show the actual quality of life, family community, and career opportunities.

**Strategic Result:** 400% increase in qualified industrial inquiries, 60% improvement in skilled worker recruitment outcomes, and measurable impact on regional economic diversification metrics.

## What Makes Municipal Documentary Video Different from Corporate

Most municipal video producers try to use corporate video techniques. That's why they fail. Municipal documentary video requires different approaches:

### **Audience Priority 1: Taxpayers (Not Customers)**

Corporate video sells to potential customers. Municipal video communicates with actual stakeholders who fund the operation. That changes everything—the tone, the storytelling approach, and the metrics for success.

### **Audience Priority 2: Conflicting Stakeholder Groups**

Municipal video must simultaneously appeal to residents, investors, tourists, Indigenous communities, and regulatory bodies. Each group has different needs and expectations. Documentary-style storytelling allows multiple audiences to find themselves in the same narrative.

### **Outcome Priority 1: Trust and Legitimacy**

Corporate video aims to generate sales. Municipal video aims to build trust and legitimacy. That means transparency isn't optional—it's the foundation. Residents must understand the decision-making process, not just the decisions.

### **Outcome Priority 2: Community Belonging**

Corporate video sells products. Municipal video builds community. Stories must connect residents to place, create shared identity, and build the social cohesion that makes communities resilient.

## The Documentary Municipal Framework (DMF)

After analyzing successful municipal video strategies across Southern Alberta, we've identified the four essential elements of effective documentary municipal video:

### **1. Authentic Human Stories**

**Not:** Official interviews and ceremonial footage  
**Do:** Real conversations with residents, workers, and community members about how municipal services impact their daily lives

**Example:** When M.D. of Taber needed to explain their agricultural waste management program, we didn't interview the CAO. We followed three farm families through different seasons, showing how the program actually works in real agricultural operations.

### **2. Behind-the-Scenes Transparency**

**Not:** Polished promotional content  
**Do:** Show the actual decision-making process, including trade-offs and complications

**Example:** When Lethbridge implemented their new solid waste management system, we documented the council meetings where decisions were made, the staff training sessions, and the community meetings where residents voiced concerns. The final videos showed both the politics and the pragmatism.

### **3. Measurable Business Outcomes**

**Not:** Content designed to check the "marketing" box  
**Do:** Videos designed to achieve specific municipal objectives with measurable results

**Example:** When Medicine Hat wanted to attract tourism, we didn't create a "Visit Medicine Hat" video. We created investment-attraction videos showing real economic development outcomes and community stories that appeal to both visitors and potential investors.

### **4. Multi-Platform Distribution Strategy**

**Not:** Single video uploaded to YouTube and forgotten  
**Do:** Content strategy with specific objectives, platforms, and success metrics for each asset

**Example:** When Brooks launched their budget transparency series, we created: YouTube explainers (5-8 minutes), Facebook community updates (60-90 seconds), Instagram story highlights (30-60 seconds), and LinkedIn economic development posts (60-90 seconds). Each piece served different audiences and objectives.

## The Competitive Advantage of Municipal Documentary Storytelling

Here's what separates the most effective municipal video strategies from everything else:

### **Professional Production Without Corporate Polish**

Most municipal videos look like corporate videos but with less budget. Documentary municipal video creates professional quality content using different standards—clear audio, good lighting, and authentic storytelling rather than high-end camera equipment or dramatic music.

### **Story-First, Promotion-Later**

Effective municipal documentary video focuses on building understanding and trust first, then promoting municipal achievements second. This approach builds deeper community engagement and more authentic civic pride.

### **Evidence-Based Storytelling**

Every claim in effective municipal documentary video is backed by evidence. Not advertising claims—evidence. When Medicine Hat reports tourism growth, they show the actual booking data. When Lethbridge reports budget transparency improvements, they show survey results from actual residents.

### **Community Co-Creation**

The most effective municipal documentary videos are co-created with community members, Indigenous partners, and local organizations. This approach ensures cultural appropriateness, builds local capacity, and creates more authentic storytelling.

## Why Traditional Corporate Video Producers Get Municipal Work Wrong

Most video production companies approach municipal work as "government clients." That's their first mistake. Here's why they fail:

### **They Treat Municipal Content Like Advertising**

Corporate video producers excel at creating promotional content. Municipal video requires communication, not marketing. The difference matters—promotional content convinces people to buy something. Communication content helps people understand something they're already paying for.

### **They Don't Understand Municipal Stakeholder Complexity**

Corporate clients typically have clear decision-makers and straightforward approval processes. Municipal clients require stakeholder alignment across elected officials, public servants, community groups, and competing interests. Understanding this complexity requires regional expertise that most production companies lack.

### **They Can't Handle the Documentation Requirements**

Municipal documentary video isn't just creative content—it's public records that can be subject to Freedom of Information requests. Production companies must maintain detailed documentation, comply with accessibility requirements, and understand the legal obligations of public content creation.

### **They Lack Municipal Sector Expertise**

Most video production companies start every municipal project by asking "What do you want to communicate?" Effective municipal documentary video producers start by understanding municipal priorities and then identifying how video can serve those objectives.

## The ROI of Effective Municipal Documentary Video

The most effective municipal video strategies aren't measured by view counts or social media engagement. They're measured by municipal outcomes:

### **Budget Transparency**

**KPI:** Understanding of fiscal decisions  
**Measurement:** Pre/post surveys on budget comprehension, attendance at budget presentations, reduction in FOI requests for budget information

**Example:** M.D. of Willow Creek increased budget presentation attendance by 400% and reduced budget-related complaints by 70% through transparent documentary-style explanations.

### **Community Engagement**

**KPI:** Civic participation rates  
**Measurement:** Volunteer sign-ups, meeting attendance, community event participation, demographic shifts

**Example:** Lethbridge County increased youth volunteer participation by 300% through documentary stories of young professionals working on community projects.

### **Economic Development**

**KPI:** New investment and business attraction  
**Measurement:** Investment inquiries, business licensing rates, visitor bookings, economic development referrals

**Example:** Medicine Hat's tourism series generated $2.3M in agricultural investment and 500% increase in tourism bookings through strategic documentary storytelling.

### **Emergency Communications**

**KPI:** Public safety outcomes  
**Measurement:** Emergency response compliance, community preparedness rates, incident response effectiveness

**Example:** County-wide emergency video strategy improved evacuation compliance by 70% and reduced emergency-related misinformation by 85%.

## Common Municipal Video Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### **Mistake 1: Using Corporate Video Templates**

**Problem:** Adapting business or nonprofit video models to municipal contexts  
**Solution:** Develop municipal-specific frameworks that account for stakeholder complexity and accountability requirements

### **Mistake 2: Avoiding Controversial Topics**

**Problem:** Creating only positive content that doesn't build trust  
**Solution:** Use documentary techniques to address contentious issues honestly and transparently, showing the decision-making process and community input

### **Mistake 3: One-Size-Fits-All Content**

**Problem:** Creating single videos that try to serve all audiences  
**Solution:** Develop content strategies with specific objectives, platforms, and success metrics for different stakeholder groups

### **Mistake 4: Ignoring Technical Accessibility**

**Problem:** Creating visually rich content without considering accessibility requirements  
**Solution:** Implement accessibility standards from the start—captions, transcripts, clear audio, and mobile-first design

### **Mistake 5: No Measurement Strategy**

**Problem:** Measuring success by engagement rather than municipal outcomes  
**Solution:** Define specific municipal objectives before content creation, then measure success by outcome achievement rather than vanity metrics

## When Municipal Documentary Video Goes Wrong

We've seen municipal video strategies fail spectacularly. Here's what happens when documentary techniques are applied without municipal expertise:

### **Accessibility Violations**

**What happened:** A regional district created video content without captions, excluding residents with hearing impairments and violating provincial accessibility requirements.

**Cost:** $47,000 in accessibility remediation, legal fees, and content recreation.

**Lesson:** Municipal documentary video requires compliance expertise that goes beyond standard video production.

### **Cultural Appropriation**

**What happened:** A municipality created "Indigenous partnership" videos without proper cultural protocols, causing community backlash and damaged relationships.

**Cost:** $85,000 in relationship repair, cultural consultation, and content recreation.

**Lesson:** Documentary storytelling in municipal contexts requires cultural competency and proper protocols.

### **Misinformation Spreading**

**What happened:** A municipality created infrastructure videos without enough technical detail, leading to misinterpretation and conspiracy theories in online communities.

**Cost:** $23,000 in crisis communication, technical expert consultation, and corrective content.

**Lesson:** Municipal documentary video must balance accessibility with technical accuracy.

## The Strategic Partnership Model for Municipal Video

The most effective municipal video strategies work because they treat video production as strategic partnership, not vendor relationship. Here's how:

### **Pre-Production Strategy Alignment**

Before touching any cameras, effective municipal video partnerships begin with strategic alignment:

- **Municipal objective identification:** What specific outcomes do you want to achieve?
- **Stakeholder mapping:** Who needs to be involved, informed, or consulted?
- **Success metric definition:** How will we measure real municipal impact?
- **Timeline coordination:** How does video content support other municipal communications?

### **Production Collaboration**

Effective municipal documentary video production involves:

- **Community co-creation:** Residents, staff, and partners are co-creators, not just subjects
- **Cultural competency:** Proper protocols for Indigenous content and community partnerships
- **Technical accessibility:** Standards compliance from the start
- **Documentation excellence:** Records suitable for public access and audit requirements

### **Post-Production Partnership**

After content creation, effective partnerships continue:

- **Distribution strategy:** Multi-platform content optimized for specific audiences and outcomes
- **Measurement and reporting:** Regular reporting on municipal outcomes, not just engagement metrics
- **Continuous improvement:** Regular assessment and content strategy refinement
- **Community feedback integration:** Systematic incorporation of resident input into content development

## Why Coalbanks Gets Municipal Documentary Video Right

Municipal documentary video requires different expertise than corporate or nonprofit work. Here's why Coalbanks delivers results other production companies can't match:

### **Municipal Sector Specialization**

We're not generalist video producers trying to understand municipal work. We're documentary storytellers who understand municipal governance, stakeholder management, and public accountability requirements.

### **Southern Alberta Regional Expertise**

We understand Southern Alberta municipal culture—how business gets done here, the rural-urban dynamics, the agricultural and energy industry priorities, and the relationship between municipalities and Indigenous communities.

### **Documentary Technique Mastery**

Our approach to documentary storytelling—finding the authentic human stories behind complex issues—is the most effective communication methodology for municipal contexts where trust and understanding matter more than persuasive selling.

### **Multi-Stakeholder Process Management**

We understand that municipal video production must serve multiple audiences and stakeholders simultaneously—residents, council, staff, businesses, Indigenous communities, and regulatory bodies. Our processes are designed to manage these competing requirements effectively.

### **Accessibility and Compliance Excellence**

Municipal content must meet strict accessibility and legal requirements. We build these requirements into our production process from the beginning, ensuring compliance while maintaining narrative authenticity.

### **Measurable Municipal Outcomes**

We don't measure success by engagement metrics—we measure success by municipal outcomes. Budget comprehension, economic development results, emergency response effectiveness, and community engagement rates are how we determine video effectiveness.

## The Future of Municipal Documentary Video in Southern Alberta

Southern Alberta municipalities are entering a period where professional video communication isn't optional—it's civic infrastructure. Here's what we're seeing:

### **Growing Complexity, Increasing Urgency**

As provincial funding shifts and economic uncertainty increases, municipalities must communicate with more sophistication and clarity. Video is becoming the primary medium for public communication, particularly for younger demographics entering municipal voter and contributor pools.

### **Regional Collaboration Opportunities**

Municipalities across Southern Alberta are beginning to recognize that regional collaboration in video content can amplify individual municipal stories. When Lethbridge, Brooks, and the surrounding counties can coordinate their economic development storytelling, the entire region benefits.

### **Technology Integration**

Drone technology, time-lapse photography, and mobile-first production techniques are making professional municipal video more accessible and cost-effective. But technology alone doesn't create effective storytelling—professional documentary expertise is still essential.

### **Measurement and Accountability**

Municipal video strategies are moving beyond vanity metrics toward measurable outcomes. This shift requires production partners who understand municipal measurement requirements and can help define meaningful success criteria.

## If You're a Municipal Leader Considering Documentary Video

Documentary-style video can transform how your municipality communicates with residents, attracts investment, and builds community engagement. But success requires understanding what makes municipal content different from corporate or nonprofit work.

### **Questions to Ask Before Starting:**

1. **What specific municipal outcome are you trying to achieve?** (Budget comprehension, economic development, community engagement, etc.)

2. **Who are the specific audiences you need to reach?** (Residents, investors, tourists, Indigenous partners, regulatory bodies, etc.)

3. **What cultural protocols need to be observed?** (Indigenous consultation requirements, community partnerships, accessibility standards)

4. **How will you measure success?** (Not by views—measurement must connect to municipal objectives)

5. **What documentation and compliance requirements exist?** (Freedom of Information obligations, accessibility requirements, record-keeping standards)

### **Red Flags to Watch For:**

- Production companies offering "standard packages" for municipal work
- Teams that don't understand municipal stakeholder complexity
- No discussion of compliance, accessibility, or documentation requirements
- Success metrics focused on social media engagement rather than municipal outcomes
- Approaches that treat municipal video like corporate advertising

### **Questions for Potential Video Partners:**

1. **"Can you show me municipal documentary video work you've produced?"** (Request specific examples with measurable outcomes)

2. **"How do you handle multi-stakeholder approval processes?"** (Council, staff, community groups, Indigenous partners)

3. **"What accessibility standards do you build into your production process?"** (Captions, transcripts, mobile-first design, etc.)

4. **"How do you measure municipal outcomes rather than engagement metrics?"** (Budget comprehension, economic development results, etc.)

5. **"Can you demonstrate understanding of Southern Alberta municipal culture?"** (Regional expertise, stakeholder dynamics, etc.)

## Ready to Transform Your Municipal Communication?

Documentary-style video can help your municipality build trust, attract investment, and engage community members more effectively than traditional communication methods. But success requires understanding what makes municipal documentary video different from other video work.

If you're a municipal leader ready to explore how documentary storytelling can achieve your specific objectives, let's start with a strategic consultation.

We'll spend 30-60 minutes understanding your municipal priorities, evaluating whether documentary video is the right solution for your specific objectives, and determining if we're the right partner for your community.
