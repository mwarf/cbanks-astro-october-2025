**Southern Alberta doesn't respond to corporate speak.**

We respond to stories about people who understand the land. Who respect the work. Who know that success isn't just about profit—it's about building something that lasts.

Here's how to connect with audiences in Lethbridge, Lethbridge County, and across Southern Alberta through video that actually resonates.

## The Alberta Way: What Our Audiences Actually Care About

### We Respect the Land

**In Southern Alberta, the land isn't just property. It's heritage.**

With nearly 1 million irrigated acres and agriculture contributing nearly 20% to our regional GDP, land stewardship runs deep. But it's not just farmers—it's everyone from energy workers maintaining solar farms to manufacturers building with sustainably sourced materials.

**What this means for your video:**

- Show people working with the land, not just on it
- Highlight seasonal cycles and natural rhythms
- Connect your business to the landscape that sustains us
- Respect the science behind sustainable practices

**Example:** Instead of "We use advanced irrigation technology," try "Meet Sarah, whose family has farmed these same coulees for four generations. Here's how modern irrigation keeps her grandfather's legacy alive."

### We Value Real Work and Real Workers

**Skilled tradespeople, farmers, manufacturers, healthcare workers—this is who built Southern Alberta.**

Our manufacturing sector exports $2.229 billion annually. Our renewable energy projects like Travers Solar (465 MW) and Rattlesnake Ridge (117 MW) are world-class. But behind every project are people who understand that good work requires skill, dedication, and pride.

**What this means for your video:**

- Feature actual employees, not actors
- Show the expertise behind your operation
- Highlight mentorship and knowledge transfer
- Recognize the skill in everyday work

**Example:** Instead of "Our team has expertise," try "Mike's been welding aerospace components for 23 years. He taught our new apprentice the difference between good enough and right the first time."

### We're Pragmatic, Not Pretentious

**Albertans have zero patience for fluff.**

We judge businesses on what they deliver, not how fancy their marketing sounds. Our population grew 4.1% to 111,400 because people choose to live here—they want substance over style.

**What this means for your video:**

- Cut the corporate jargon
- Show actual results and outcomes
- Use straightforward language
- Focus on practical benefits

**Example:** Instead of "We leverage cutting-edge solutions to optimize performance," try "Our solar farm generates enough power for 65,000 homes. Here's how we do it."

### We Respect Indigenous Reconciliation

**Southern Alberta's future includes acknowledging and learning from Indigenous heritage.**

The Blood Tribe Nation, Piikani Nation, and Siksika Nation all have deep connections to this land. Our region's growth happens with and alongside Indigenous communities.

**What this means for your video:**

- Acknowledge Indigenous territories respectfully
- Include Indigenous voices where appropriate
- Show partnerships and collaboration
- Learn about local Indigenous history

**Example:** "Produced on the traditional lands of the Blackfoot Confederacy. We acknowledge and respect the Indigenous peoples whose territories this land represents."

## Industry-Specific Storytelling for Southern Alberta

### Agriculture & Agri-Food (20% of Regional GDP)

Southern Alberta's landscape is part of our identity. When filming, use our geography to support your story.

**Do this:**

- Film during golden hour to capture the light of the prairies
- Include recognizable local landmarks when appropriate

Albertans aren't into fancy talk. We use fewer words to say more, and we appreciate when others do the same.

**Do this:**

- Include moments of genuine conversation

**Example:** Instead of scripted interviews, use conversations captured during actual work activities, with the natural pauses and authentic thinking processes.

Albertans appreciate seeing the actual work behind results. We want to understand the skill, the effort, and the expertise required.
