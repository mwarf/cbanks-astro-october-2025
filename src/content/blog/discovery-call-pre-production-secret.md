# The Discovery Call That Changes Everything

_The most important work happens before we pick up a camera._

---

Here's an uncomfortable truth: **79% of video agencies end up doing free work** because they didn't ask the right questions upfront.

We learned this the hard way. A manufacturing client hired us for a "recruitment video." Three weeks into production, we discovered they actually needed to solve a retention problem, not an attraction problem. We had to start over.

That $8,000 mistake taught us something: **discovery is our competitive advantage.**

Today, clients tell us they've "never felt so understood" by a creative agency. We rarely encounter scope creep. And our videos move business metrics instead of just winning awards.

Let's pull back the curtain on what happens during that first conversation.

## Why Most Video Projects Fail Before Filming Starts

The gap between "pretty video" and "effective video" is closed during discovery.

Here's what goes wrong when companies skip it:

### The Assumption Trap
The client says "recruitment video" and the agency assumes they know what that means. But a recruitment video for welders looks completely different than one for engineers. Seasonal timing matters for agriculture. Regulatory compliance is existential for energy companies.

### The Feature Fallacy
Clients lead with what they want to show (new equipment, facility tour) rather than what they need to achieve (reduce time-to-hire by 30%, increase qualified applicants). Features are easy to discuss. Outcomes require deeper conversation.

### The Alignment Failure
Marketing wants brand awareness. Operations wants safety compliance. HR wants recruitment. Finance wants ROI. **Without discovering what success looks like to each stakeholder, you'll produce a video that pleases no one.**

Research shows fixing problems at the planning stage costs **10-100 times less** than fixing them during production or after delivery.

## Our Discovery Framework

Our discovery process uncovers three things:

1. **What story actually exists** (not what you think exists)
2. **What business outcome you're trying to create** (not what type of video you think you need)
3. **What success looks like in measurable terms** (not vague aspirations)

### The 4-Phase Discovery Process

**Phase 1: Understand Your Business (15-20 min)**

We're not asking about your video yet. We're asking about your business:
- What's happening in your industry right now?
- What challenge made video seem like the right solution?
- What have you already tried that didn't work?

**Example:** A Lethbridge manufacturing client requested a "recruitment video." Discovery revealed their real problem was retention—seasoned welders were leaving because they didn't feel valued. We created a "day in the life" series showcasing their craftsmanship. **Turnover dropped 40% in six months.**

**Phase 2: Identify the Real Problem (20-25 min)**

We dig deeper with targeted questions:
- "Where in your process do you lose the people you actually want?"
- "If this continues for 12 months, what does that cost you?"
- "How would showing your career path change recruitment conversations?"

Most agencies stop after identifying the problem. **We go deeper to discover what the video actually needs to accomplish.**

**Phase 3: Mine for Stories (25-30 min)**

Your best stories already exist. We ask:
- "Tell me about a time your team solved the impossible."
- "What customer interaction reminded you why you're in this business?"
- "What do your best employees say about you that surprises you?"

**Example:** For an agriculture client near Brooks, we asked: "What's the biggest misconception about modern farming?" That led to a conversation about precision agriculture and environmental stewardship. The resulting video got **14,000 views and 120+ shares** in a region with 14,000 residents.

**Phase 4: Map Stakeholders (10-15 min)**

Who cares about this video's success? What does success look like to each person?

For a Lethbridge nonprofit, we discovered "donor engagement" meant different things to the development director (recurring donors), program manager (volunteers), and board chair (major gifts). **We created one video optimized for mid-level donors, with three cut-down versions for other audiences.**

## The Questions That Uncover Authentic Stories

After hundreds of discovery calls, these questions consistently surface stories worth telling:

### "What do people say about you that surprises you?"

This bypasses corporate messaging and reveals authentic perception. An energy client was surprised that landowners praised their "obsessive communication." That became the emotional core of their community relations video.

### "Tell me about a decision that tested your values."

Corporate values are meaningless until they're stress-tested. A manufacturing client told us about turning down a lucrative contract because the client wanted them to cut safety corners. That story—told by the shop foreman—became their recruitment video's anchor. **Applications from experienced tradespeople increased 65%.**

### "What does everyone in your industry do that you refuse to do?"

Differentiation isn't about being better—it's about being different in ways that matter. An agriculture client refuses growth hormones, even though it makes cattle take longer to reach market weight. That commitment became their brand story.

## The ROI of Doing Discovery Right

Our discovery process takes 90-120 minutes of dedicated time. Here's why it pays off:

**Reduced Scope Creep:** Clients who go through discovery request **73% fewer changes** during production (our data across 89 projects).

**Faster Approvals:** When stakeholders are involved in discovery, approval cycles shrink from **11 days to 4 days**.

**Higher Performance:** Videos informed by discovery achieve success metrics **2.3x more often** than "quick video" projects.

**Better Relationships:** **94% of our repeat clients** cite "feeling understood" as why they come back.

But the biggest ROI is the work we *don't* do. That manufacturing project? Three weeks of wasted work, $8,000 in absorbed costs, a frustrated client. **We've never let that happen again.**

## Why Southern Alberta Businesses Need This

Southern Alberta's business landscape makes discovery even more critical:

**Technical Complexity:** Energy, agriculture, and manufacturing aren't simple. Generic agencies create generic content because they don't understand the nuances.

**Relationship-Driven Culture:** You don't hire vendors—you build partnerships. Discovery is where that partnership begins.

**Practical Problem-Solving:** This region doesn't have patience for fluff. **We establish clear metrics during discovery. If we can't define success in measurable terms, we're not ready for production.**

## What to Expect

If you're considering a video project with Coalbanks, here's our discovery process:

### Before the Call
We'll send a short questionnaire (8-10 questions) designed to help you reflect on what you're trying to accomplish. Spending 20 minutes with these makes our call 10x more productive.

### The Call (90-120 min)
Have key stakeholders present—the 2-4 people who care most about outcomes. Marketing, operations, leadership, HR—whoever will measure success.

The call will feel more like a strategic conversation than a creative pitch. We're going to ask a lot of questions and dig into your business challenges.

### After the Call (Within 5 Days)
We'll send:
1. **Discovery Summary:** Everything we learned, in your words
2. **Strategic Recommendation:** What we believe you actually need
3. **Creative Brief:** Core message, narrative approach, success metrics
4. **Project Proposal:** Scope, timeline, investment, deliverables

This isn't take-it-or-leave-it. It's the start of a refinement conversation.

## The Bottom Line

Discovery isn't glamorous. It doesn't win awards. It's not the part that shows up in portfolio reels.

But it's the most important work we do.

A video is successful when it solves a business problem, moves a metric, or changes how someone thinks, feels, or acts.

**That only happens when we start with deep understanding.**

The discovery call is where that understanding gets built. It's the conversation that prevents $50,000 mistakes. It's the foundation of every successful video we've ever produced.
