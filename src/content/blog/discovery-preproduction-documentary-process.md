# Discovery & Pre-Production: Where Great Films Begin

_Documentary-style films start with deep discovery—not cameras._

---

This is Part 2 of our documentary process series. [Read Part 1: Why Our 4-6 Week Process Works →](/blog/why-4-week-documentary-process-works)

Most video companies rush straight to production. We spend **2 weeks finding your story** first.

Here's exactly what happens during discovery and pre-production—and why it's the most valuable part of our process.

## Week 1: Discovery & Story Development

### Day 1-2: Initial Client Interviews

**What we do:**
- 60-90 minute conversation with key decision-makers
- Deep dive into your business, challenges, and goals
- Understand your audience and what they care about
- Identify the human story behind your brand

**What you get:**
- Clear understanding of your story direction
- Confidence that we "get" your business
- Timeline and next steps

**Real example:** For an energy company, we spent 90 minutes understanding not just their services, but their role in keeping power on during extreme weather. That became the heart of their story.

---

### Day 3-4: Stakeholder & Employee Conversations

**What we do:**
- 30-45 minute interviews with 3-5 team members
- Focus on real experiences, not rehearsed answers
- Identify potential interview subjects for filming

**What you get:**
- Multiple perspectives on your story
- Additional story elements to explore
- Confidence in our interview approach

These conversations often reveal the best stories. The person doing the work usually knows more than the marketing department about what makes you different.

---

### Day 5-6: Story Development & Planning

**What we do:**
- Synthesize all conversations into story themes
- Develop narrative structure and key messages
- Create shot list and production plan
- Prepare interview questions and filming approach

**What you get:**

- Confirmed production schedule
- Clear next steps and timeline
- Confidence in our approach

### Why Discovery Matters

**Most video companies skip this or rush through it.** That's why their videos sound generic.

Our discovery phase is the foundation of everything else:
- Ensures your video tells the right story
- Identifies the best people to feature
- Creates a roadmap for efficient production
- Sets expectations for outcomes and results

**Time investment:** 15-20 hours of professional work  
**Value delivered:** Story clarity and production efficiency

## Week 2: Pre-Production & Planning

### Day 8-9: Location Scouting & Logistics

**What we do:**

- Test lighting and audio conditions
- Coordinate access and permissions
- Plan equipment setup and movement

**What you get:**
- Confirmed filming locations and times
- Equipment and crew requirements
- Potential challenges identified and solved
- Efficient filming schedule

**Why this matters:** Scouting prevents day-of surprises. We know exactly what we're walking into, which means we can focus on capturing great content instead of solving technical problems.

---

### Day 10-11: Final Interview Preparation

**What we do:**

- Prepare backup questions and topics

**What you get:**
- Participants feel prepared and confident
- Questions that elicit authentic responses

**Pro tip:** We never ask participants to memorize anything. We want natural conversation, not performance. Our questions are designed to get them talking about what they care about.

---

### Day 12-13: Equipment & Crew Preparation

**What we do:**
- Prepare all camera and audio equipment
- Coordinate crew schedule and roles
- Test all technical systems

**Time investment:** 10-15 hours of professional work  
**Value delivered:** Smooth production and professional results

## The Discovery Advantage

### What We Learn in Week 1:

**The Real Story:** A manufacturing client requested a "recruitment video." Discovery revealed their real problem was retention. We shifted strategy completely, resulting in a 40% reduction in turnover.

**The Right People:** An agriculture client assumed their CEO should be the primary voice. Discovery identified a fourth-generation farmer whose passion made the film unforgettable.

**The Hidden Differentiator:** An energy client thought their story was about technology. Discovery revealed it was about community reliability. That became their winning message.

### What Happens Without Discovery:

- Generic content that sounds like everyone else
- Wrong people featured in the video
- Message that doesn't resonate with target audience
- Wasted budget on re-shoots and revisions

**Our data:** Clients who go through thorough discovery request **73% fewer changes** during production.

## What This Looks Like for You

### Before Discovery Week:

We'll send a short questionnaire (8-10 questions) to help you prepare. Spending 20 minutes with these questions makes our discovery meetings 10x more productive.

### During Weeks 1-2:

Expect 3-4 meetings/calls:
- Initial discovery (60-90 min)
- Stakeholder interviews (30-45 min each)
- Discovery review (30-45 min)
- Final pre-production check-in (15-30 min)

**Total time commitment from you:** 4-6 hours over 2 weeks

### After Week 2:

You'll have:
- Complete story outline
- Confirmed production schedule
- List of people we'll interview
- Shot list and location plan
- Clear timeline to delivery

## The Bottom Line

**Discovery and pre-production are where great films begin.**

This is the work that separates videos people skip from films people watch. It's where we find the real story, identify the right people, and plan for efficient execution.

Traditional agencies spend this time writing scripts and planning corporate setups. **We spend it finding your authentic story.**

That's why our films get watched—and why our clients rarely need revisions.
