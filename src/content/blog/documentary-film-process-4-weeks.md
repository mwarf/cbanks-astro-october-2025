_Documentary-style brand films that deliver faster without cutting corners._

---

**Most video companies take 8-12 weeks.**

They spend weeks in meetings, months in post-production, and endless cycles of revisions.

**We deliver in 4-6 weeks.**

Here's exactly how we do it without compromising quality, story, or results.

## Why Most Video Processes Take Too Long

### Traditional Corporate Video Timeline:

**Week 1-2:** Initial meetings and brief development
**Week 3-4:** Script writing and storyboarding
**Week 5-6:** Equipment booking and scheduling
**Week 7-9:** Production (often spread across multiple days)
**Week 10-15:** Post-production editing
**Week 16-18:** Revisions and final approval
**Week 19-20:** Final delivery

**Total: 4-5 months**

**The problems:**

- Endless meetings that don't add value
- Scripts that sound corporate instead of authentic
- Production stretched across too many days
- Post-production that prioritizes perfection over storytelling
- Revision cycles that go nowhere

### Our Documentary Approach: 4-6 Weeks

**Week 1:** Discovery and story development
**Week 2:** Pre-production and planning
**Week 3:** Production (2-3 focused days)
**Week 4-5:** Post-production and first cut
**Week 6:** Final revisions and delivery

**Total: 4-6 weeks**

**The advantages:**

- Focused discovery that actually finds your story
- Documentary-style efficiency in production
- Post-production that serves the story, not the schedule
- Clear revision process with specific goals
- Faster time-to-impact for your marketing
