## 5:30 AM at a Lethbridge Manufacturing Facility

The sun isn't up yet, but the facility has been running for two hours. Third shift is ending in 90 minutes, and we need to capture the shift handoff—the moment when outgoing machinists brief their replacements on the status of complex, multi-day projects.

Our crew is geared up: hard hats, safety glasses, steel-toed boots, and high-visibility vests. We've been through a 30-minute safety orientation. Our equipment has been inspected for loose cables that could create trip hazards. Our audio engineer is wearing industrial ear protection over his headphones.

This isn't a soundstage. This is a working factory floor with CNC machines, overhead cranes, and strict safety protocols. The ambient noise level is 92 decibels—about as loud as a motorcycle. The lighting is harsh fluorescent mixed with bright task lighting at individual workstations. Metal surfaces create unpredictable reflections.

And somewhere in this challenging environment, we need to capture authentic moments that will make potential employees think: "That's where I want to work."

Welcome to manufacturing video production—where the story we're trying to tell meets the reality of where stories actually happen.

Let me pull back the curtain on what actually goes into filming in industrial environments, the challenges you'd never expect, the solutions we've developed over dozens of projects, and why behind-the-scenes content itself has become one of our most powerful marketing tools.

## Why Manufacturing Video is Different (And Why That Matters)

If you've never worked on an industrial film shoot, you might assume it's just "video production in a different location."

You'd be wrong.

Manufacturing and industrial environments present unique challenges that fundamentally change how we approach production:

### Safety Isn't Optional—It's Existential

On a corporate office shoot, the biggest safety concern is someone tripping over a cable. On a manufacturing floor, there are forklifts, overhead cranes, moving machinery, hot surfaces, high voltage, and confined spaces.

Before we ever press record, we need:

- **OSHA-compliant PPE** for every crew member
- **Site-specific safety training** (which can take 30 minutes to 4 hours depending on the facility)
- **Facility permits and approvals** from safety managers and operations
- **Hot work permits** if we're using any lighting that generates heat
- **Lock-out/tag-out awareness** for filming near machinery
- **Emergency evacuation procedures** in case something goes wrong

For one energy sector client, we spent two full days completing confined space training and obtaining permits before we could film inside a pressure vessel during a maintenance shutdown. The filming itself took four hours. The preparation took 16.

This isn't bureaucracy—it's life-and-death risk management. And it fundamentally shapes our production planning and costs.

### The Environment Doesn't Care About Your Equipment

Factory floors are loud, bright, dusty, and sometimes wet. Precision camera equipment doesn't love any of those conditions.

We've filmed in environments where:

- **Noise levels reached 100+ decibels** (permanent hearing damage territory without protection)
- **Dust from grinding operations** required covering equipment between takes
- **Temperature swings** from 45°F in cold storage areas to 95°F near heat-treating ovens created condensation on lenses
- **Metal shavings and debris** on floors meant extra care with equipment cases and cables
- **Overhead cranes** required constant communication with operators to pause movement during dialogue takes

Our equipment insurance specifically covers industrial environments. We carry backup cameras in case primary equipment fails. We plan 30% more time than equivalent corporate shoots because challenging conditions slow everything down.

### You Can't Fake Authenticity

This is the paradox of manufacturing video: the environment that makes filming difficult is exactly what makes the content credible.

Viewers can tell the difference between a staged "factory" scene shot on a clean soundstage and actual working conditions. The machinery sounds different. The lighting looks different. The employees move differently.

A recruitment video shot in a pristine, empty facility during a weekend shutdown will attract people who want a pristine, empty workplace. But if your actual environment is loud, active, and gritty—and you're looking for people who thrive in that environment—you need to show the reality.

The challenge is capturing that authentic reality in a way that's visually compelling and emotionally engaging rather than chaotic and overwhelming.

That's where craft and experience matter.

## Pre-Production: The Work That Happens Before We Arrive

Manufacturing shoots don't start when we arrive on-site. They start weeks earlier with meticulous planning.

### The Site Survey

For any manufacturing project, we conduct at least one site visit before the shoot day. Sometimes two or three.

We're looking for:

**Safety considerations:** What hazards exist? What PPE is required? Are there restricted areas? What's the emergency evacuation plan?

**Lighting challenges:** Where are natural light sources? What's the artificial lighting situation? Are there areas with harsh contrast or difficult mixed lighting?

**Sound environment:** What's the ambient noise level? Are there periodic noise spikes (alarms, machinery cycles)? Where can we capture clean dialogue?

**Operational flow:** What activities happen when? Where do the meaningful moments occur? How much space do we have to work without disrupting operations?

**Storytelling opportunities:** What visual elements are unique and interesting? Where are the compelling details? What would surprise or impress someone unfamiliar with the operation?

For a precision agriculture equipment manufacturer near Medicine Hat, our site survey revealed that the most interesting work happened in a 12-foot-wide assembly aisle between two production lines. We had to completely redesign our lighting and camera approach to work in that confined space.

Without the site survey, we would have shown up with the wrong equipment and wasted half a day problem-solving.

### The Scheduling Dance

Manufacturing operates on schedules that don't care about ideal filming conditions.

We work around:

- **Production schedules:** We can't stop a line that produces $15,000 of product per hour for aesthetic lighting adjustments
- **Shift timing:** The people we need to interview might work second or third shift
- **Seasonal demands:** Agriculture equipment manufacturers are slammed during planting and harvest seasons
- **Maintenance windows:** Sometimes the best filming opportunity is during a planned shutdown when we can get access to equipment that's normally running 24/7

For one project, we ended up filming across three separate days—two weekdays during first shift for active production scenes, one Saturday during a maintenance window for close-ups of specific equipment, and one evening for second shift interviews with veteran employees.

The client asked why we couldn't "just do it all in one day." Because the story we needed to tell only existed across those three timeframes.

### Cast (But They're Not Actors)

One of the biggest differences between manufacturing video and traditional corporate content: our "cast" consists of actual employees doing their actual jobs.

They're not actors. Most have never been on camera. Many are uncomfortable with attention. Some are skeptical about the whole project ("Why are we doing this? Won't the video make us look bad?").

Our pre-production includes:

- **Interviewing potential on-camera participants** to find people who are articulate, authentic, and representative of the workforce we're trying to showcase
- **Pre-interview conversations** to understand their stories and make them comfortable with us before cameras come out
- **Setting expectations** about what the shoot day will look like and what we need from them
- **Getting buy-in** by explaining why their participation matters

For a manufacturing recruitment project, we identified a 28-year veteran welder as a key interview subject. He initially refused—"I'm not good at talking." We spent 20 minutes with him over coffee, just listening to his stories about learning the trade, mentoring apprentices, and the satisfaction of precision work.

By the end of that conversation, he understood that we weren't asking him to perform—we were asking him to share what he already knew. He became one of the most compelling interview subjects we've ever filmed. His segment has been viewed 47,00 times and directly influenced 23 job applications (they asked about him specifically).

The pre-production relationship-building made that possible.

## Shoot Day: What Actually Happens on Set

Let's walk through what a typical manufacturing shoot day looks like—using that Lethbridge facility as an example.

### Hour 1: Safety and Setup (5:30 AM - 6:30 AM)

We arrive early, check in with the safety manager, complete sign-in procedures, and review the day's safety plan.

While the safety briefing happens, our production assistant (PA) is doing a final check on all equipment: cameras, lenses, audio recorders, lavalier mics, lighting, batteries, cables, memory cards.

We've learned the hard way that industrial environments are unforgiving. A failed battery or faulty cable 45 minutes from the nearest rental house can derail an entire shoot day.

### Hour 2-3: B-Roll Capture (6:30 AM - 8:30 AM)

We start with B-roll—the environmental shots and activity footage that will provide visual support for the narrative.

Our shot list includes:

- **Wide establishing shots** showing the facility scale and layout
- **Medium shots** of specific work areas and equipment
- **Close-ups** of hands operating controls, precision measurement, quality inspection
- **Detail shots** of sparks from welding, metal shavings from machining, part assemblies
- **Movement shots** using gimbals or sliders to add production value

We're looking for moments that communicate:

**Complexity:** This work requires skill and expertise  
**Precision:** Quality and attention to detail matter here  
**Scale:** The magnitude of what's being produced  
**Human element:** People are central to this operation, not just machines

A critical technique: we shoot B-roll in sequences, not isolated shots.

Instead of just "a shot of a CNC machine," we capture:

1. Wide shot establishing the machine in its work area (5-7 seconds)
2. Medium shot of operator at controls (5-7 seconds)
3. Close-up of hands adjusting settings (5-7 seconds)
4. Extreme close-up of cutting tool engaging material (5-7 seconds)
5. Close-up of finished part being measured (5-7 seconds)
6. Medium shot of operator inspecting and nodding approval (5-7 seconds)

This sequence tells a story: skill → precision → quality. In editing, we can use the full 30-second sequence or cut individual shots based on narrative needs.

### Hour 3-4: The Shift Handoff Scene (8:30 AM - 9:30 AM)

This is the moment we came for—the shift handoff where outgoing machinists brief their replacements.

We're using two cameras:

**Camera A (primary):** Shoulder-mounted, following the handoff conversation as machinists walk between workstations  
**Camera B (secondary):** Locked down on a tripod, capturing wide shots and cutaways

Both machinists are wearing wireless lavalier microphones clipped inside their shirts, hidden but capturing clean dialogue despite the 92-decibel ambient noise.

Our audio engineer is monitoring levels in real-time, using a mixer to balance the two lav mics and manage noise from overhead announcements and equipment.

The challenge: capturing authentic conversation without making the machinists self-conscious.

Our technique:

**Before cameras roll:** "We're just going to follow your normal handoff routine. Forget we're here as much as possible. If something goes wrong or you need us to stop, just say so—we can always reset."

**During the scene:** Our cinematographer stays mobile but predictable. The machinists know roughly where he is, but he's not directing them: "Stand here, say this."

**After the first take:** "That was great. Let's do it one more time—same routine, but take your time. The camera can wait for you, so don't rush on our account."

The second take is almost always better. They're more comfortable, less aware of the camera, more natural in their explanations.

We capture three takes total. In editing, we'll likely use moments from all three, cutting together the most authentic and clear exchanges.

### Hour 4-5: Formal Interviews (9:30 AM - 10:30 AM)

After the active B-roll capture, we shift to sit-down interviews with key employees.

We've set up an interview area in a quieter section of the facility—still clearly "on the factory floor" for visual authenticity, but away from the worst noise sources.

Our lighting setup:

- **Key light:** Large soft source (usually a 4x4' LED panel with diffusion) positioned at 45 degrees to the subject
- **Fill light:** Bounced LED panel to soften shadows
- **Backlight:** Small LED aimed from behind to separate the subject from the background
- **Background elements:** We position the subject so machinery or workstations are visible but slightly out of focus in the background

This three-point lighting setup creates a polished, professional look while keeping the authentic manufacturing environment visible.

Audio is critical here. We're using:

- **Lavalier mic** clipped to the subject's shirt (primary audio source)
- **Boom mic** positioned just out of frame above the subject (backup audio)
- **Room tone recording** captured separately to use in editing for smoothing audio transitions

Our interview technique focuses on making non-actors comfortable:

**Conversational, not interrogational:** We're having a discussion, not conducting an interview. I'll share my thoughts, react to their answers, create natural back-and-forth.

**Story-focused questions:** "Tell me about a time when..." rather than "Do you like working here?"

**Permission to pause:** "If you need to collect your thoughts or start over, just stop. We can always pick it up again."

**Active listening:** I'm genuinely interested in their answers, which shows in my body language and follow-up questions.

For that 28-year veteran welder, the question that unlocked his best content was: "What do you wish people understood about welding?"

His answer: "It's not just melting metal. It's metallurgy, geometry, understanding how different materials behave at different temperatures. Every weld is problem-solving. Young guys come in thinking it's all muscle and sparks—but the best welders are the ones who can think three steps ahead."

That 90-second response became the emotional core of the recruitment video. It repositioned welding from "labor" to "skilled craft," which is exactly what the client needed to attract the right candidates.

### Hour 5-6: Additional B-Roll and Wrap (10:30 AM - 11:30 AM)

With interviews complete, we have narrative clarity. We know what stories we're telling and what visual support we need.

We spend the final hour capturing:

- **Specific shots mentioned in interviews** (e.g., the welding technique the veteran described)
- **Details we missed earlier** now that we understand the operation better
- **Safety moments** that show the culture (team meetings, PPE compliance, housekeeping)
- **Human connections** (mentorship moments, teamwork, problem-solving)

We also record **room tone**—60 seconds of "silence" with no one talking and normal ambient factory noise. This is essential for audio editing to create smooth transitions between dialogue segments.

Before we leave, we:

- **Thank everyone** who participated or accommodated our presence
- **Confirm we have all necessary footage** by reviewing critical shots on-site
- **Return any borrowed PPE** and sign out properly
- **Debrief with the client** about what we captured and next steps

By 11:30 AM, we're packed up and leaving. Six hours on-site. Roughly 4 hours of actual filming. 180 GB of footage captured across two cameras.

The real work is just beginning.

## The Challenges Nobody Warns You About

Beyond the obvious challenges (noise, lighting, safety), there are unexpected difficulties that only experience reveals.

### The Union Consideration

Many manufacturing facilities have unionized workforces, which adds layers of complexity:

- **Permission and notification requirements** for filming union members
- **Compensation questions** if we're using employees as on-camera talent
- **Script or interview approval** processes in some cases
- **Sensitivity about how work is portrayed** (we can't make footage look like safety violations)

We learned this after filming a manufacturing client and later discovering that union leadership was uncomfortable with how efficiency was portrayed—it looked like speed was prioritized over safety (it wasn't, but perception matters).

Now we proactively engage with union representatives during pre-production, explain our approach, and sometimes include union leadership in interviews to address workforce culture and partnership.

### The Proprietary Technology Problem

Manufacturers often have proprietary processes, equipment configurations, or products in development that can't be filmed.

We need to know:

- **What can and can't be shown?** (Get this in writing.)
- **Who makes that determination?** (Engineering? Legal? Operations?)
- **What happens if proprietary material accidentally appears in B-roll?** (We delete it immediately and document the deletion.)

For one agriculture equipment client, an entire assembly area was off-limits because it contained next year's model. We had to completely redesign our shot list to work around it.

### The "Just Stop the Line for a Minute" Request

Here's a common misunderstanding: clients sometimes expect us to pause production for perfect filming conditions.

"Can you just stop that machine for a minute so we can get a clean shot?"

On a line producing $10,000 per hour of product, stopping for "a minute" costs real money. More importantly, stopping and starting equipment can be unsafe or require recalibration.

We design our approach to work _with_ operations, not against them:

- **Filming during natural pauses** (shift changes, breaks, scheduled maintenance)
- **Using longer lenses to capture shots from safe distances** rather than asking operators to move
- **Coordinating with supervisors** to identify low-impact filming windows

When we absolutely need a pause (like getting a specific close-up), we plan it in advance, minimize the disruption, and express genuine appreciation for the accommodation.

### Employee Camera Shyness and Skepticism

Not everyone is comfortable on camera. Some are actively resistant.

Common concerns we hear:

- **"What if I say something wrong?"** (Fear of making the company look bad)
- **"I'm not good at talking."** (Performance anxiety)
- **"Why do you need to film me? Can't you use someone else?"** (Discomfort with attention)
- **"What are you really doing with this footage?"** (Distrust of corporate motives)

Our approach:

**Transparency about the project:** We explain exactly what the video is for, who will see it, and how it will be used.

**Permission to decline:** "If you're not comfortable, that's completely fine. We only want to work with people who want to participate."

**Pre-interviews build comfort:** By the time cameras come out, we've already had a conversation. They know we're interested in their authentic experience, not a corporate script.

**Show, don't tell:** When possible, we show examples of previous work to demonstrate that we make people look good, not foolish.

One skeptical machinist told us: "I'll do this, but if you make me look like an idiot, I'll be pissed." Fair enough. When he saw the final cut, he shared it on his personal LinkedIn with the caption: "Proud to be part of this team."

That's trust earned.

## The Equipment That Makes It Possible

Manufacturing video requires specialized equipment choices.

### Cameras

We use **mirrorless or cinema cameras** (typically Sony A7S III or Canon C70) rather than larger cinema cameras. Why?

- **Smaller footprint** in tight spaces
- **Better low-light performance** for dimly lit work areas
- **Quieter operation** (no mechanical shutter slap)
- **Faster setup** for mobile shots

We avoid bulky rigs that make us look like a film crew disrupting operations. We want to be as unobtrusive as possible.

### Lenses

**24-70mm f/2.8 zoom:** Versatile focal lengths for 80% of shots  
**70-200mm f/2.8 telephoto zoom:** Shooting from safe distances  
**16-35mm f/2.8 wide-angle:** Establishing shots in tight quarters

All lenses are fast (f/2.8 or wider) for low-light capability.

### Audio

This is where manufacturing shoots get technically demanding.

**Wireless lavalier microphones** (Sennheiser G4 or Sony UWP-D series): These clip inside subjects' shirts and transmit audio to our recorder. Critical for capturing clean dialogue in noisy environments.

**Shotgun mic on boom pole** (Sennheiser MKH 416): For capturing directional audio and backup dialogue.

**Industrial ear protection with monitor integration:** Our audio engineer wears hearing protection that still allows him to monitor audio levels—protecting his hearing while doing his job.

**Post-production noise reduction:** Even with great field audio, we use iZotope RX software in editing to reduce machinery noise, hum, and environmental interference.

### Lighting

We use **battery-powered LED panels** (Aputure, Nanlux) that we can position quickly without needing access to power outlets.

Key advantages:

- **Portable and fast to deploy**
- **Bi-color capability** (adjust from warm to cool to match existing facility lighting)
- **Dimmable** for precise exposure control
- **No heat** (unlike traditional tungsten lights, which would require hot work permits)

For interview setups, we might use 3-4 lights. For run-and-gun B-roll, we often rely on natural/available light supplemented by one small on-camera LED.

### Stabilization

**Gimbal stabilizers** (DJI Ronin or Zhiyun Crane) allow us to create smooth, cinematic movement shots while following action through the facility.

**Slider:** For controlled camera movements in sit-down interviews or detail shots.

The goal isn't flashy camera moves—it's adding subtle motion that makes the content more visually engaging than locked-down static shots.

## From Footage to Story: The Post-Production Journey

Six hours of filming. 180 GB of footage. Forty-seven individual video clips. Twelve interview segments totaling 83 minutes of raw content.

Now the real storytelling begins.

But that's a topic for another article. (Stay tuned for "Where the Story Comes Together: A Glimpse into Our Editing Suite.")

## Why We Share Behind-the-Scenes Content (And Why You Should Too)

Here's an unexpected benefit of manufacturing video: the behind-the-scenes content itself has become one of our most effective marketing tools.

When we share Instagram Stories of our crew on a factory floor at 5:30 AM, or post LinkedIn updates about navigating OSHA compliance for a shoot, or create TikTok videos showing the difference between "planned shot" and "what actually happened," we get massive engagement.

Why?

**Transparency builds trust.** Clients see the professionalism, preparation, and problem-solving that goes into our work. They understand why our pricing reflects the expertise required.

**It's inherently interesting.** People are fascinated by "how things are made"—including how videos are made.

**It humanizes our brand.** We're not just a vendor. We're craftspeople who take pride in solving complex challenges.

**It sets expectations.** Prospective clients see what's involved and come to discovery calls better prepared and more realistic about timelines and requirements.

Our most-viewed piece of content last year? A 60-second TikTok showing the contrast between a raw interview clip (awkward pause, stumbled words, background noise) and the final edited version (tight pacing, clean audio, compelling delivery). It demonstrated the transformation that editing creates.

That video generated six qualified leads and two signed projects. Total production time: 12 minutes.

Behind-the-scenes content isn't just marketing—it's education, relationship-building, and trust development.

## What Manufacturing Clients Should Know Before Filming

If you're a manufacturer considering video content, here's what you need to know:

### Budget for Proper Planning

A manufacturing video shoot isn't just "filming for a few hours." It's:

- Site surveys and pre-production planning (8-12 hours)
- Safety compliance and permit acquisition (4-6 hours)
- Actual filming (6-10 hours depending on complexity)
- Post-production editing and revisions (20-40 hours)

Expect professional manufacturing video to cost **$8,000-$25,000** depending on length, complexity, and deliverables. That's not overpriced—it's realistic for the expertise, equipment, and time required.

### Allow Adequate Time

From discovery call to final delivery, expect **6-10 weeks** for a polished manufacturing video project.

Rush jobs are possible but expensive (premium rates for expedited schedules) and often compromise quality because we can't schedule around optimal operations timing.

### Involve Operations Early

Your marketing team might initiate the project, but operations needs to be involved from the start.

They know:

- When meaningful work actually happens
- Which employees would be good on camera
- What safety protocols apply
- What can and can't be shown

The best manufacturing videos come from collaboration between marketing (strategy/messaging) and operations (authenticity/access).

### Trust the Process

You're hiring professionals because we've done this dozens of times in environments like yours.

When we recommend filming during second shift, or suggest interviewing the veteran machinist instead of the operations manager, or want to capture seemingly mundane moments like shift handoffs—trust that we're seeing storytelling opportunities based on experience.

The magic happens when clients give us access to authentic moments rather than staging what they think we need.

## The Payoff: When the Video Actually Works

Remember that recruitment video for the manufacturing client—the one featuring the 28-year veteran welder talking about welding as skilled craft?

Three months after launch:

- **23 qualified applications** directly attributed to the video (candidates mentioned it in applications)
- **65% increase in applications from experienced tradespeople** (vs entry-level)
- **40% reduction in turnover** among first-year hires (better job/expectation alignment)
- **47,000 views** across YouTube, LinkedIn, and Facebook
- **Employee pride:** Current employees shared it widely, improving morale and culture

The client's investment: $15,000.

The value of reducing turnover by 40%: approximately $180,000 annually (based on replacement costs of $45,000 per skilled machinist).

ROI: 1,200% in the first year alone.

That's what happens when the complexity of manufacturing video production creates something authentic enough to change minds, build pride, and drive measurable business outcomes.

It's why we show up at 5:30 AM wearing hard hats, navigate OSHA compliance, work around production schedules, and invest hours planning for minutes of footage.

Because when it works—when the story we capture is real enough and compelling enough to change someone's perception of your company—it's worth every challenge along the way.
