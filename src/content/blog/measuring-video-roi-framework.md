"The video's great, but how do we know it's actually working?"

We hear this on every discovery call. Business owners want proof—not just "it looks good."

Here's the reality: **93% of video marketers report positive ROI** with an average 5:1 return. But knowing video _can_ work and proving _yours_ works are different things.

The difference? A proper measurement framework.

## Why Most Video ROI Calculations Fail

Four common mistakes tank video measurement:

**The vanity metrics trap.** "Our video got 10,000 views!" means nothing if none became customers.

**Single-touch attribution.** Crediting video alone ignores the full customer journey. Buyers interact with multiple touchpoints before deciding.

**Wrong KPIs.** Measuring what looks impressive instead of what drives growth. Completion rates matter less than qualified leads.

**No baseline.** Without knowing your starting point, you can't measure improvement.

## The 3-Tier ROI Framework

Here's the measurement system that actually delivers insights:

### Tier 1: Engagement (Short-term)

- Video completion rates
- Click-through rates to website
- Time on landing pages post-video
- Social sharing and engagement

### Tier 2: Lead Generation (Medium-term)

- Form submissions from video viewers
- Phone inquiries mentioning video
- Email signups attributed to video
- Meeting requests from video pages

### Tier 3: Revenue Attribution (Long-term)

- Closed deals with video-influenced first contact
- Customer lifetime value changes
- Referral rates from video viewers
- Repeat business attribution

**The key:** Track all three tiers simultaneously. Engagement without leads is noise. Leads without revenue data is guesswork.

## Real-World Example: 747% ROI

Here's how proper measurement works in practice:

**The setup:**

- 3 documentary-style customer story videos
- $15,000 production investment
- Distribution: website, LinkedIn, email

**60-day results:**

| Metric              | Result   | Benchmark          |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Completion rate     | 89%      | 23% industry avg   |
| Qualified inquiries | 47       | Mentioning video   |
| Sales meetings      | 23       | From video viewers |
| Closed revenue      | $127,000 | Direct attribution |

**ROI: 747% return. Payback period: 23 days.**

The authentic documentary approach drove 3x higher completion rates—which directly correlated with lead quality and conversions.

## Essential KPIs by Business Type

### Lead Generation Companies

**Track first:**

- Cost per qualified lead from video traffic
- Lead-to-opportunity conversion rate
- Sales cycle length for video-educated prospects
- Average deal size for video-influenced customers

### Product/Sales Companies

**Track first:**

- Direct sales attribution to video
- Cart conversion rates with video
- Product page engagement time
- Customer acquisition cost changes

## Multi-Touch Attribution (The Right Way)

Single-touch attribution lies. Here's a weighted model that reflects reality:

| Touchpoint      | Weight | Role                             |
| --------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Video content   | 40%    | Awareness + emotional connection |
| Landing page    | 25%    | Information + lead capture       |
| Email follow-up | 20%    | Nurturing                        |
| Sales contact   | 15%    | Closing                          |

This model acknowledges that video often starts the conversation—even when other channels close it.

## Red Flags: When Video ROI Isn't Working

Monitor these warning signs:

- **Completion rates below 20%** → Content problem
- **Video leads converting under 10%** → Targeting problem
- **No revenue correlation** → Attribution problem
- **High bounce rates after video** → Technical problem

### Quick Diagnostic

Can you answer these questions?

1. What percentage of viewers complete your video?
2. How many viewers request more information?
3. What's your video-to-lead conversion rate?
4. How much revenue ties directly to video?

If not, your measurement framework needs work.

## Your 30-Day Measurement Kickstart

**Week 1:** Audit current metrics. Establish baselines.

**Week 2:** Set up tracking—UTM parameters, conversion pixels, CRM integration.

**Week 3:** Launch video with full measurement in place.

**Week 4:** Review data. Optimize distribution. Gather sales team feedback.

**Month 1 success metrics:**

- Completion rates above 30%
- 5%+ of viewers take next action
- Clear video-to-website attribution
- Sales team confirms lead quality

## The ROI Formula

**Basic calculation:**

```
ROI = (Revenue Generated - Video Investment) / Video Investment × 100
```

**Example:**

- Investment: $8,000 (production)
- Revenue generated: $67,000 (attributed sales)
- ROI: ($67,000 - $8,000) / $8,000 × 100 = **738% ROI**

**But that's overly simple.** Here's what you're actually measuring:

### The Complete ROI Model

**Direct Revenue Impact:**

- New customer sales attributed to video
- Upsells to existing customers who watched
- Deal acceleration (closed faster due to video)

**Cost Savings:**

- Reduced sales cycle length
- Lower customer acquisition cost
- Decreased support inquiries (explainer videos)
- Time saved by sales team (video does initial qualification)

**Long-term Value:**

- Customer lifetime value increase
- Referral rate improvements
- Brand equity growth
- Recruitment cost reduction (if using for hiring)

## Real Numbers from Southern Alberta Clients

### Manufacturing Company: Recruitment Video

**Investment:** $12,000
**Timeline:** 4 weeks production

**Results (6 months):**

- 47,000 views across platforms
- 23 qualified applications (previous recruitment efforts: 4-6 applications)
- 12 hires from video applicants
- Turnover reduction: 40% in first year

**ROI Calculation:**

- Cost to replace employee: ~$15,000 (recruiting + training + lost productivity)
- Employees retained due to better cultural fit: 5
- Savings: 5 × $15,000 = $75,000
- ROI: ($75,000 - $12,000) / $12,000 = **525% ROI**

### Energy Company: Stakeholder Communication

**Investment:** $15,000 (3 videos)
**Timeline:** 6 weeks production

**Results (60 days):**

- 89% completion rate (vs 23% industry average)
- 47 qualified inquiries mentioning video
- 23 sales meetings booked
- $127,000 in closed deals directly attributed

**ROI:** ($127,000 - $15,000) / $15,000 = **747% ROI**
**Payback period:** 23 days

### Agriculture Co-op: Brand Awareness Campaign

**Investment:** $10,000
**Timeline:** 5 weeks production

**Results (90 days):**

- 156,000 organic views
- 2,400 website visits from video
- 340 new email subscribers
- 67 membership applications
- $43,000 in new membership revenue

**ROI:** ($43,000 - $10,000) / $10,000 = **330% ROI**

**The pattern:** Authentic storytelling consistently delivers 300-700% ROI when properly measured.

## How to Set Up Proper Tracking

Most companies fail at measurement because they don't set up tracking _before_ launch. Here's what you need:

### Technical Setup (Week 1-2)

**1. UTM Parameters**

Tag every video link with tracking codes:

```
https://yoursite.com/services?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=brand_story_2025
```

This tells Google Analytics exactly where traffic came from.

**2. Conversion Pixels**

Install these _before_ you launch:

- Facebook Pixel (if using paid distribution)
- LinkedIn Insight Tag (for B2B)
- Google Analytics events (for video plays, completions, clicks)

**3. CRM Integration**

Connect your video metrics to your CRM:

- Tag leads that came from video viewers
- Track which videos they watched
- Monitor their journey through your sales funnel
- Attribute revenue to specific video content

**4. Video Hosting Analytics**

Use platforms that track detailed metrics:

- Vimeo Pro: Completion rates, engagement graphs, heatmaps
- Wistia: Lead capture, CTA clicks, A/B testing
- YouTube Analytics: Watch time, demographics, traffic sources

### What to Track (and Why)

**Tier 1 Metrics: Engagement**

- Views (total reach)
- Completion rate (content quality)
- Average watch time (engagement level)
- Social shares (viral potential)

**Tier 2 Metrics: Lead Generation**

- Video-to-website clicks (intent)
- Form fills from video pages (qualified interest)
- CTA clicks (action taken)
- Email/phone contact from video viewers

**Tier 3 Metrics: Revenue**

- Deals with video in customer journey (attribution)
- Revenue from video-influenced leads (direct impact)
- Customer lifetime value of video leads vs. other sources (quality)
- Time to close for video-educated prospects (efficiency)

## Common Measurement Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Only Tracking Views

10,000 views means nothing if:

- 95% bounced after 5 seconds
- Zero converted to leads
- None resulted in revenue

**Fix:** Track completion rate and conversion, not just views.

### Mistake 2: No Control Group

How do you know the video caused the improvement?

**Fix:** Compare periods before/after video launch. Or compare video viewers vs. non-viewers in your CRM.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Assisted Conversions

Video rarely gets 100% of the credit. Someone might:

1. Watch video
2. Visit website later
3. Read case study
4. Contact sales
5. Close deal

Google Analytics defaults to "last click" attribution—giving credit to step 4, not the video.

**Fix:** Use Google Analytics "Assisted Conversions" report to see video's true impact.

### Mistake 4: Not Tracking Negative Metrics

What if your video is _hurting_ performance?

**Monitor:**

- Bounce rate (are people leaving immediately?)
- Unsubscribes after video emails
- Negative comments/feedback
- Drop-off points in video (where do people quit?)

If bounce rate spikes after video launch, you have a targeting or content problem.

## The 90-Day Measurement Plan

Here's exactly what to do:

**Days 1-30: Establish Baseline**

- Document current conversion rates without video
- Set up all tracking infrastructure
- Launch video with full measurement in place

**Days 31-60: Gather Initial Data**

- Monitor all three metric tiers
- Look for early win signals (completion rates, click-throughs)
- Make minor optimization adjustments (CTA placement, distribution channels)

**Days 61-90: Calculate ROI**

- Pull complete data set
- Calculate direct attribution
- Identify assisted conversions
- Present findings to stakeholders

**Success Benchmarks:**

- Completion rate >40% (documentary-style average: 73%)
- Video-to-website click rate >5%
- Lead conversion >2% of viewers
- Positive ROI within 90 days

## When Video ROI Doesn't Work

Sometimes video legitimately doesn't deliver. Here's when:

**Wrong Use Case**

- Trying to sell complex B2B services with a 30-second clip
- Using video for audiences that prefer text (highly technical buyers sometimes do)
- Expecting immediate sales from brand awareness content

**Wrong Distribution**

- Great video, zero promotion
- Posting once on YouTube and hoping for magic
- No paid amplification for competitive markets

**Wrong Story**

- Generic corporate messaging that could be anyone
- No clear call-to-action
- Failing to address viewer's actual pain points

**Wrong Measurement**

- Expecting recruitment video to generate immediate sales
- Measuring brand awareness video with direct response metrics
- Not giving video enough time to compound (most ROI happens months 3-12, not month 1)

## The Bottom Line

Video ROI is measurable. But measurement requires:

1. Clear objectives before production
2. Proper tracking setup before launch
3. Commitment to analyzing actual data, not vanity metrics
4. Patience for compounding results

The companies seeing 300-700% ROI aren't lucky. They're systematic about measurement.
