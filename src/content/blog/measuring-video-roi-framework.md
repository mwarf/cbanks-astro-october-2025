"The video's great, but how do we know it's actually working?"

We hear this on every discovery call. Business owners want proof—not just "it looks good."

Here's the reality: **93% of video marketers report positive ROI** with an average 5:1 return. But knowing video *can* work and proving *yours* works are different things.

The difference? A proper measurement framework.

## Why Most Video ROI Calculations Fail

Four common mistakes tank video measurement:

**The vanity metrics trap.** "Our video got 10,000 views!" means nothing if none became customers.

**Single-touch attribution.** Crediting video alone ignores the full customer journey. Buyers interact with multiple touchpoints before deciding.

**Wrong KPIs.** Measuring what looks impressive instead of what drives growth. Completion rates matter less than qualified leads.

**No baseline.** Without knowing your starting point, you can't measure improvement.

## The 3-Tier ROI Framework

Here's the measurement system that actually delivers insights:

### Tier 1: Engagement (Short-term)

- Video completion rates
- Click-through rates to website
- Time on landing pages post-video
- Social sharing and engagement

### Tier 2: Lead Generation (Medium-term)

- Form submissions from video viewers
- Phone inquiries mentioning video
- Email signups attributed to video
- Meeting requests from video pages

### Tier 3: Revenue Attribution (Long-term)

- Closed deals with video-influenced first contact
- Customer lifetime value changes
- Referral rates from video viewers
- Repeat business attribution

**The key:** Track all three tiers simultaneously. Engagement without leads is noise. Leads without revenue data is guesswork.

## Real-World Example: 747% ROI

Here's how proper measurement works in practice:

**The setup:**
- 3 documentary-style customer story videos
- $15,000 production investment
- Distribution: website, LinkedIn, email

**60-day results:**

| Metric | Result | Benchmark |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Completion rate | 89% | 23% industry avg |
| Qualified inquiries | 47 | Mentioning video |
| Sales meetings | 23 | From video viewers |
| Closed revenue | $127,000 | Direct attribution |

**ROI: 747% return. Payback period: 23 days.**

The authentic documentary approach drove 3x higher completion rates—which directly correlated with lead quality and conversions.

## Essential KPIs by Business Type

### Lead Generation Companies

**Track first:**
- Cost per qualified lead from video traffic
- Lead-to-opportunity conversion rate
- Sales cycle length for video-educated prospects
- Average deal size for video-influenced customers

### Product/Sales Companies

**Track first:**
- Direct sales attribution to video
- Cart conversion rates with video
- Product page engagement time
- Customer acquisition cost changes

## Multi-Touch Attribution (The Right Way)

Single-touch attribution lies. Here's a weighted model that reflects reality:

| Touchpoint | Weight | Role |
|------------|--------|------|
| Video content | 40% | Awareness + emotional connection |
| Landing page | 25% | Information + lead capture |
| Email follow-up | 20% | Nurturing |
| Sales contact | 15% | Closing |

This model acknowledges that video often starts the conversation—even when other channels close it.

## Red Flags: When Video ROI Isn't Working

Monitor these warning signs:

- **Completion rates below 20%** → Content problem
- **Video leads converting under 10%** → Targeting problem
- **No revenue correlation** → Attribution problem
- **High bounce rates after video** → Technical problem

### Quick Diagnostic

Can you answer these questions?

1. What percentage of viewers complete your video?
2. How many viewers request more information?
3. What's your video-to-lead conversion rate?
4. How much revenue ties directly to video?

If not, your measurement framework needs work.
