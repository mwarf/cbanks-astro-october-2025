# The 67.6% Problem: Why Southern Alberta Manufacturers Can't Find Workers (And How Video Changes Everything)

## The Hiring Crisis That's Crippling Growth

A Lethbridge precision manufacturer posts a millwright position. They receive 12 applications. Only 3 meet basic qualifications. One accepts the job—then quits after 6 weeks because "it's not what I expected."

This isn't a hiring problem. It's an expectations problem.

Southern Alberta manufacturers face a stark reality: **67.6% report skills gaps**, yet traditional recruitment methods leave both employers and candidates guessing about fit, culture, and day-to-day reality. The result? High turnover, longer time-to-hire, and growing frustration on both sides.

But some manufacturers are solving this crisis with a simple tool that changes everything: authentic video recruitment content.

## The Numbers Tell a Brutal Story

Here's what manufacturing employers are up against in 2025:

- **One in four factory workers is 55+** and approaching retirement
- **Apprenticeship completion rates are just 20%** nationwide
- **22,500 workers retire annually** in Ontario alone
- **Manufacturing wages lag construction by $2.87/hour** on average
- **40% cite skilled-worker recruiting as a barrier** to automation adoption

In Southern Alberta, the challenges are magnified. With manufacturing exports worth $2.229 billion USD and a growing population (Lethbridge hit 111,400 in 2024, up 4.1%), the region needs more skilled workers, not less.

But here's the kicker: **The problem isn't a lack of people. It's a lack of connection.**

## Why Traditional Recruitment Fails Manufacturing

Most manufacturers recruit like this:

1. Post a job description with bullet points
2. Wait for resumes
3. Interview candidates who may never have seen the actual work environment
4. Hope for the best

This approach fails for three critical reasons:

### Problem #1: Manufacturing Work Is Hard to Describe

Try explaining precision machining, safety protocols, or quality control in a job posting. You can't capture the sounds, the pace, the teamwork, or the satisfaction of creating something that matters.

**Real Example**: A Lethbridge aerospace manufacturer spent 6 months trying to fill a CNC operator role. Traditional job postings generated interest, but candidates consistently withdrew after facility tours revealed the actual work intensity.

### Problem #2: Candidates Don't Know What They Don't Know

Many manufacturing jobs require skills and mindsets that aren't obvious from a job description. Without seeing the actual environment, candidates can't realistically assess whether they'll thrive.

**Common Mismatches**:

- Expecting quiet, solo work (reality: teamwork and communication essential)
- Thinking manufacturing means repetitive tasks (reality: problem-solving and continuous improvement)
- Underestimating safety requirements (reality: protocols are strict but critical)

### Problem #3: The Best Candidates Have Options

Top manufacturing talent is in demand. They're not going to choose a company based on a generic job posting when they can see, hear, and experience workplaces through video content from competitors.

## What Works: The Video Recruitment Revolution

Forward-thinking manufacturers are discovering that authentic video content solves the expectations problem. The results are compelling:

### Case Study 1: FMC Technologies' Employee Spotlight Strategy

**Challenge**: High turnover in challenging roles
**Solution**: Weekly employee spotlight videos showing real workers discussing their job satisfaction, career paths, and day-to-day responsibilities

**Results**:

- **300% increase in email click-through rates**
- **40x higher sharing rate** than text content
- **Significant reduction in early-stage resignations**
- **Increased quality of applications** from candidates who understood the role

**Key Insight**: When candidates see real people thriving in the role, they can honestly assess fit before applying.

### Case Study 2: Stellantis Employee Series Approach

**Challenge**: Attracting talent in competitive market
**Solution**: Long-form employee profiles combined with short-form social content

**Results**:

- **High retention rates** among hires who viewed content
- **Increased local community support** for manufacturing careers
- **Improved employer brand recognition**
- **Higher application quality** from better-informed candidates

**Key Insight**: Employee testimonials build trust and set realistic expectations that reduce turnover.

### Case Study 3: Plant Magazine's Facility Tour Best Practices

**Challenge**: Conveying complex manufacturing environments
**Solution**: Professional facility tours with expert commentary and safety highlights

**Results**:

- **157% increase in organic traffic** to recruitment pages
- **80% improvement in landing page conversion rates**
- **Reduced time-to-hire** by several weeks
- **Higher offer acceptance rates**

**Key Insight**: When candidates see the facility before applying, they arrive with realistic expectations and stronger commitment.

## The 4 Video Types That Transform Manufacturing Recruitment

## Southern Alberta's Manufacturing Video Advantage

Why should Southern Alberta manufacturers lead this video recruitment revolution?

### 1. **Export-Quality Storytelling**

Your manufacturing creates products that ship globally. Show that quality and craftsmanship to attract top talent.

## The Mobile-First Reality: Where Candidates Actually Look

Here's a statistic that changes everything: **95% of job seekers use smartphones** for job research, and **6% of all applications** now come through mobile devices.

Your recruitment videos must be designed for mobile consumption:

### Mobile Video Optimization Essentials:

- **Captions always on** (most watch without sound initially)
- **Vertical or square formats** for social discovery
- **Clear call-to-action** within first 15 seconds

- **Easy application process** directly from video

### Platform Distribution Strategy:

- **LinkedIn**: Professional reach, excellent for longer-form content

- **Community Engagement**: Tag local schools, trade programs

## Measuring What Matters: Video Recruitment ROI

The best manufacturing recruiters measure video performance beyond views. Focus on these metrics:

### Primary Metrics

- **Application Rate**: Applications per video view
- **Quality Score**: % of applicants meeting basic qualifications

- **Social Shares**: Organic reach and brand mentions
- **Inquiry Rate**: Direct contact from video viewers

### ROI Calculation Example

**Investment**: $8,00 video production
**Results**: 25% reduction in time-to-hire, 40% improvement in quality score
**Savings**: Reduced recruiting costs, lower turnover, faster productivity
**Payback Period**: 2-3 months

## Common Manufacturing Video Recruitment Mistakes (Avoid These)

### Mistake #1: Over-Polishing the Reality

**Wrong**: Studio-quality videos with perfect lighting and scripted responses
**Right**: Authentic footage showing real work, real people, genuine conversations

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Safety Communication

**Wrong**: Focusing only on the "cool" aspects of manufacturing
**Right**: Prominently featuring safety protocols, training, and accident prevention

### Mistake #3: One-Size-Fits-All Content

**Wrong**: Same video for all positions (CNC, assembly, quality control)
**Right**: Role-specific content that sets accurate expectations for each position

### Mistake #4: Treating Video as a One-Time Project

**Wrong**: "We made a recruitment video"
**Right**: Ongoing content strategy with regular updates, seasonal content, and new employee spotlights

### Mistake #5: Poor Mobile Optimization

**Wrong**: Desktop-optimized videos with tiny text and slow loading
**Right**: Mobile-first design with captions, clear visuals, and fast performance
