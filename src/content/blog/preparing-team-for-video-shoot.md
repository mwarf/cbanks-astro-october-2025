_Forget the script. Ignore the lens. Just be you._

"I'm not an actor."

It's the first thing we hear on almost every shoot. And our response is always the same: **"Good. We don't want you to be."**

If we wanted actors, we would have hired them. We're filming you because you know the business, you live the culture, and you have the expertise.

But we get it. A camera lens can be intimidating. Even the most confident CEO can freeze up when the red light turns on.

The goal of this guide is simple: to de-mystify the process and help your team show up as their best, most authentic selves.

## The Golden Rule: Don't Memorize a Script

This is the biggest mistake people make. They try to memorize a "perfect" answer.

Here's what happens:
1. You get nervous trying to remember the exact words.
2. Your eyes glaze over as you recite them from memory.
3. If you miss one word, you panic and stop.
4. You sound like a robot.

**Instead:** Know your talking points, not your lines.

If we ask, "Tell us about your safety culture," don't memorize a corporate mission statement. Just think about what you'd tell a new employee on their first day.

## What to Expect on Shoot Day

Fear comes from the unknown. Here’s exactly what the environment will feel like:

### It won't be live.
There is no "live" TV here. If you stumble, we stop. We laugh. We start over. We might film 30 minutes of conversation to get 30 seconds of gold. The editor's job is to make you look articulate and smart. **You cannot "ruin" a take.**

### It's a conversation, not a speech.
You won't be staring down the barrel of a lens (unless it's a specific direct-to-camera message). You'll be looking at an interviewer—a real human being—sitting just off-camera. You're just having a chat. The camera is just eavesdropping.

### There will be lights (and silence).
It might feel a bit bright. The room will be quiet. People might be standing around listening. This is normal. Take a breath.

## Wardrobe: What to Wear (and What to Avoid)

You want to look professional but comfortable. If you never wear a tie, don't wear one now.

### The "No-Go" List:
*   **Tight patterns:** Tiny checks, pinstripes, or herringbone can cause a "moire effect" (a weird vibrating visual glitch on camera). Solids are safer.
*   **All White or All Black:** Pure white can blow out (look glowing), and pure black can lose all texture.
*   **Noisy Jewelry:** Dangling earrings or bracelets that clatter on the table can ruin audio.
*   **Logos:** Avoid giant logos (unless it's your company branding).

### The "Yes" List:
*   **Solid colors:** Blues, greys, earth tones, and pastels look great.
*   **Your Uniform:** If you wear PPE or a branded polo every day, wear that! Authenticity wins.
*   **Comfort:** If you feel stiff in a suit, you'll look stiff. Wear what makes you feel confident.

## Body Language Hacks

*   **Plant your feet.** If you're standing, don't sway. Plant your feet shoulder-width apart.
*   **Sit on the edge.** If you're sitting, don't slouch back into a soft chair. Sit on the front edge—it naturally straightens your posture and keeps your energy up.
*   **Use your hands.** If you talk with your hands normally, do it on camera! It adds energy. If you don't know what to do with them, just rest them comfortably in your lap.

## For the Leadership: How to Prep Your Employees

If you're asking your team to be on camera, set them up for success.

1.  **Tell them WHY.** "We're filming you because you led the XYZ project, and nobody knows it better." Make them feel valued, not conscripted.
2.  **Give them notice.** Don't spring it on them the morning of.
3.  **Make it optional.** A reluctant interviewee always looks uncomfortable. Find the people who are willing (or at least gently persuadable).

## The Bottom Line

The best moments in our documentaries aren't the polished, perfect sentences. They're the moments of real passion. The laugh after a joke. The thoughtful pause before a deep answer.

We can light you perfectly and record you clearly, but only you can bring the authenticity.

So take a breath. Trust the crew. And just tell your story.
