## The Production & Post Advantage

### What Makes Our Approach Different:

**1. Documentary-Style Efficiency**

Documentary filmmakers work with constraints—limited time, natural lighting, authentic moments. We bring these principles to corporate filmmaking for better content in less time.

**2. Story-First Editing**

We cut for story, not perfection. Your audience cares about the narrative, not whether every frame is technically flawless.

**3. Clear Revision Process**

We include 2 rounds of revisions with specific feedback guidelines. This prevents endless cycles and keeps the project on track.

**4. Multiple Deliverables**

You get platform-specific cuts optimized for website, social media, presentations, and more—all from the same shoot.

## Common Production Questions

### "Can we see footage during production?"

We typically share a rough cut after production wraps (Week 4). Sharing raw footage during filming can create confusion and premature feedback on unfinished work.

### "What if we need changes after delivery?"

We include 2 rounds of revisions. Minor updates after delivery (text changes, music swaps) are typically quick. Major re-edits would be a separate scope.

### "How involved do we need to be?"

**Production:** You'll need to coordinate access and introductions (2-4 hours over 2-3 days)

**Post-Production:** Review first cut and provide feedback (1-2 hours), final approval (30 minutes)

**Total time commitment:** 4-7 hours over Weeks 3-6

### "What happens if weather or scheduling changes production plans?"

We build flexibility into the schedule. If weather impacts outdoor shooting, we adjust the shot list or reschedule that specific element.

## The Bottom Line

**Production and post-production are where your story comes to life.**

But they only work because of the discovery and planning we did in Weeks 1-2. That's why we never skip those phases—they're the foundation that makes efficient production possible.

**Documentary-style filming** captures authentic moments instead of staged setups.

**Story-driven editing** creates films people want to watch instead of corporate videos they skip.

**The result:** Professional films delivered in 4-6 weeks with 73% average completion rates.
