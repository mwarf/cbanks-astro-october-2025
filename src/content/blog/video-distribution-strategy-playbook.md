We've seen it happen too many times.

A company invests $15,000 in a beautiful, strategic brand film. They love it. The team loves it. They post it on YouTube, embed it on their "About" page... and walk away.

Six months later: "The video didn't really do much."

**The video didn't fail. The launch failed.**

A video file sitting on a hard drive has zero ROI. To get value, you need **activation**.

Here is the distribution playbook we recommend to ensure your content actually gets seen by the people who matter.

## 1. The Website: Prime Real Estate

Don't bury your video in a blog post or a sub-page. If this is your flagship brand story, it needs to be front and center.

*   **The Hero Section:** Consider a silent, high-energy loop playing in the background of your homepage header (with a "Watch Full Film" button).
*   **The Landing Page:** If the video is for a specific product or service, it should be the first thing a prospect sees on that service page.
*   **The Conversion Point:** Place testimonial videos right next to your "Contact Sales" or "Request Quote" forms. High-trust video content reduces friction at the moment of decision.

## 2. LinkedIn: The B2B Powerhouse

For most of our clients (manufacturing, energy, B2B services), LinkedIn is where the decision-makers are.

**Do not just paste the YouTube link.** LinkedIn's algorithm hates external links—it will bury your post.

**The Strategy:**
1.  **Upload Natively:** Upload the video file directly to LinkedIn.
2.  **Write Context, Not Copy:** Don't just say "Check out our new video." Tell a story about the shoot. Highlight a specific quote from the film. Tag the people involved.
3.  **The "First Comment" Trick:** If you need to link to a YouTube channel or website, put that link in the first comment, not the post body.

## 3. Email: The Relationship Builder

Email is still the highest-converting channel in marketing. Use it.

*   **The "New Video" Blast:** Send a dedicated email announcing the video. "We wanted you to see this first."
*   **The Signature:** Add a thumbnail and link to your email signature: "Watch our Customer Story."
*   **The Drip Campaign:** If you have an automated welcome sequence for new leads, this video should be in email #1 or #2. It builds trust faster than text ever could.
*   **Sales Outreach:** Your sales team should be sending this video before meetings ("Here's a 2-minute overview of how we work") or after meetings ("Here's that case study we discussed").

## 4. Repurposing: Squeeze the Lemon

One 3-minute video contains dozens of pieces of content. Don't use it once.

*   **Vertical Shorts:** Cut 30-45 second vertical clips for Instagram Reels, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts. Focus on one single interesting thought or quote per clip.
*   **Quote Graphics:** Take a powerful line from the interview and turn it into a text graphic for social media.
*   **Blog Content:** Transcribe the interview and turn it into a blog post (like "5 Lessons from our CEO"). Embed the video in the post.

## 5. Paid Activation: Fuel on the Fire

Organic reach is great, but paid reach guarantees eyeballs.

You don't need a Super Bowl budget. Even **$500-$1,000** in ad spend on LinkedIn or YouTube, targeting your specific industry or region, can put your story in front of thousands of qualified prospects.

Target by:
*   Job Title (e.g., "Operations Manager")
*   Industry (e.g., "Oil & Gas")
*   Location (e.g., "Southern Alberta")

## The "Long Tail" Asset

Remember: A good video isn't a "campaign" that runs for two weeks and ends. **It's an asset.**

We have clients using the same recruitment video for three years. It's still working because the story is still true.

So don't just "post and ghost." Plan your launch. Activate your team. And make sure your investment pays off.
