_Production is only 50% of the work. Distribution is the other 50%._

We've seen it happen too many times.

A company invests $15,000 in a beautiful, strategic brand film. They love it. The team loves it. They post it on YouTube, embed it on their "About" page... and walk away.

Six months later: "The video didn't really do much."

**The video didn't fail. The launch failed.**

A video file sitting on a hard drive has zero ROI. To get value, you need **activation**.

Here is the distribution playbook we recommend to ensure your content actually gets seen by the people who matter.

## 1. The Website: Prime Real Estate

Don't bury your video in a blog post or a sub-page. If this is your flagship brand story, it needs to be front and center.

- **The Hero Section:** Consider a silent, high-energy loop playing in the background of your homepage header (with a "Watch Full Film" button).
- **The Landing Page:** If the video is for a specific product or service, it should be the first thing a prospect sees on that service page.
- **The Conversion Point:** Place testimonial videos right next to your \"Contact Sales\" or \"Request Quote\" forms. High-trust video content reduces friction at the moment of decision.

**Real example from a Southern Alberta manufacturer:**

They embedded their 8-minute brand story directly on their homepage hero section. Not autoplaying (which annoys people), but with a compelling thumbnail and "Watch Our Story" button.

**Results:**

- Homepage bounce rate: 67% → 41%
- Average session duration: 1:12 → 4:47
- Contact form completions: 12/month → 34/month
- Sales qualified leads: 40% increase

The video did the heavy lifting. By the time prospects reached the contact form, they already understood the company's values, process, and differentiation.

**Where else to embed video:**

- **Pricing page:** Explain your value before they see the number
- **FAQ page:** Answer common objections on camera
- **Thank you pages:** After form submission, deliver a personal message from founder
- **Case study pages:** Let the customer tell their own story

## 2. LinkedIn: The B2B Powerhouse

For most of our clients (manufacturing, energy, B2B services), LinkedIn is where the decision-makers are.

**Do not just paste the YouTube link.** LinkedIn's algorithm hates external links—it will bury your post.

**The Strategy:**

1.  **Upload Natively:** Upload the video file directly to LinkedIn.
2.  **Write Context, Not Copy:** Don't just say \"Check out our new video.\" Tell a story about the shoot. Highlight a specific quote from the film. Tag the people involved.
3.  **The \"First Comment\" Trick:** If you need to link to a YouTube channel or website, put that link in the first comment, not the post body.

**What this actually looks like:**

**Bad LinkedIn Post:**

> "Check out our new company video! [Link]"

**Good LinkedIn Post:**

> "At 5:30 AM last Tuesday, our crew filmed a shift handoff at [Client]'s facility.
>
> We watched a 28-year veteran machinist explain to a new apprentice why precision matters. Not corporate speak. Real talk: 'Every weld is problem-solving. The best welders can think three steps ahead.'
>
> That 90 seconds became the heart of their recruitment film. And it's exactly why we do this work.
>
> [Native video embedded]
>
> Shout out to [tag safety manager], [tag operations lead], and the entire team for trusting us with your story."

**Why the second version works:**

- Human story, not product pitch
- Specific moment people can visualize
- Tags bring people into the conversation
- Native video gets 5x more reach than links

**LinkedIn distribution checklist:**

- [ ] Upload video natively (not YouTube link)
- [ ] Write 150-200 word story (not just "watch this")
- [ ] Tag 3-5 relevant people (client, employees featured, partners)
- [ ] Add 3-5 relevant hashtags (#manufacturing #skilledtrades #southernalberta)
- [ ] Post Tuesday-Thursday, 9AM-12PM for maximum reach
- [ ] Put any external links in first comment, not post body

## 3. Email: The Relationship Builder

Email is still the highest-converting channel in marketing. Use it.

- **The \"New Video\" Blast:** Send a dedicated email announcing the video. \"We wanted you to see this first.\"\n- **The Signature:** Add a thumbnail and link to your email signature: \"Watch our Customer Story.\"\n- **The Drip Campaign:** If you have an automated welcome sequence for new leads, this video should be in email #1 or #2. It builds trust faster than text ever could.\n- **Sales Outreach:** Your sales team should be sending this video before meetings (\"Here's a 2-minute overview of how we work\") or after meetings (\"Here's that case study we discussed\").

**Real numbers from email distribution:**

An agriculture client sent their brand story video to their email list (4,200 subscribers):

**Email metrics:**

- Subject line: "You've never seen our operation like this"
- Open rate: 34% (vs. 22% average)
- Click rate: 12% (vs. 3% average)
- Video completion rate: 67%

**Business outcomes:**

- 47 replies asking questions about their process
- 12 new wholesale accounts requesting pricing
- $43,000 in new business directly attributed to the email

**Email distribution timeline:**

**Day 1:** Internal team first

- Send to employees before external launch
- They'll share it authentically (not because they have to)
- Creates momentum before public sees it

**Day 3:** Existing customers/clients

- "You're part of this story" positioning
- Ask for feedback, testimonials, referrals

**Day 7:** Email list

- Full subscriber list gets the announcement
- Segment by interest for better targeting

**Day 14:** Nurture sequences

- Add to automated sequences for new subscribers
- Include in onboarding series

**Sales team integration:**

Your sales team should have 3 email templates ready:

**Template 1: First Contact**

> "Hi [Name], saw you're looking for [solution]. Before we talk, here's a 3-minute look at how we approach this: [video link]. Worth 3 minutes of your time?"

**Template 2: Post-Meeting Follow-Up**

> "Thanks for the conversation today. Here's the case study I mentioned: [video link]. The client had the same challenge you described."

**Template 3: Breaking Through Silence**

> "Haven't heard back—totally understand you're busy. One last thing: [video link]. If this resonates, let's talk. If not, no worries."

**Result:** Sales emails with video get 3x higher response rates than text-only.

## 4. Repurposing: Squeeze the Lemon

One 3-minute video contains dozens of pieces of content. Don't use it once.

- **Vertical Shorts:** Cut 30-45 second vertical clips for Instagram Reels, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts. Focus on one single interesting thought or quote per clip.
- **Quote Graphics:** Take a powerful line from the interview and turn it into a text graphic for social media.
- **Blog Content:** Transcribe the interview and turn it into a blog post (like \"5 Lessons from our CEO\"). Embed the video in the post.

**How one 3-minute video becomes 20+ pieces of content:**

From a single brand story video, here's what we create:

**Short-form video (6-8 clips):**

- 60-second highlight reel (LinkedIn, Facebook)
- 30-second vertical clips (Instagram Reels, TikTok)
- 15-second teasers (Stories, quick hooks)

**Social graphics (4-6 images):**

- Pull quotes with speaker photos
- Behind-the-scenes production stills
- Key stats or outcomes as infographics

**Written content (3-5 pieces):**

- Blog post with embedded video
- LinkedIn article expanding on themes
- Email newsletter feature
- Case study page

**Audio content:**

- Podcast episode (interview audio standalone)
- Audiogram clips for social

**Real example:**

A manufacturing client's 4-minute recruitment video became:

- 1 full video (website, YouTube)
- 6 vertical clips (Instagram, TikTok)
- 8 quote graphics (LinkedIn, Facebook)
- 3 blog posts (career opportunities, culture, benefits)
- 12 weeks of social content

**Total reach:** 340,000 impressions from one video shoot.

**Repurposing checklist:**

- [ ] Each clip stands alone (makes sense without full video)
- [ ] Clear hook in first 3 seconds
- [ ] Specific call-to-action
- [ ] Links back to full video for deeper engagement

## 5. Paid Activation: Fuel on the Fire

Organic reach is great, but paid reach guarantees eyeballs.

You don't need a Super Bowl budget. Even **$500-$1,000** in ad spend on LinkedIn or YouTube, targeting your specific industry or region, can put your story in front of thousands of qualified prospects.

Target by:

- Job Title (e.g., \"Operations Manager\")
- Industry (e.g., \"Oil & Gas\")
- Location (e.g., \"Southern Alberta\")

**Paid distribution strategy that actually works:**

**Budget: $500-$1,000/month**

**LinkedIn Sponsored Content: $400**

- Target: Decision-makers in your industry
- Geographic: 100km radius of Lethbridge/Calgary/Medicine Hat
- Objective: Video views + website visits

**YouTube Pre-Roll: $300**

- Target: People watching industry-related content
- Format: 15-30 second cut of your full video
- Skippable after 5 seconds (you only pay for engaged views)

**Facebook/Instagram: $200-300**

- Target: Local businesses, specific demographics
- Format: Vertical video for Stories/Reels
- Objective: Brand awareness + engagement

**Expected results with $1,000/month:**

- 15,000-25,000 video views
- 500-800 website visits
- 20-40 qualified leads
- Cost per lead: $25-50

**When paid makes sense:**

- ✅ Launching new service/product
- ✅ Recruitment campaigns (need volume fast)
- ✅ Event promotion (time-sensitive)
- ✅ Competitive market entry

**When organic is enough:**

- ✅ Existing audience is engaged
- ✅ Time for slow, compound growth
- ✅ Network effects work (employees share authentically)
- ✅ SEO and inbound already working

## The "Long Tail" Asset

Remember: A good video isn't a "campaign" that runs for two weeks and ends. **It's an asset.**

We have clients using the same recruitment video for three years. It's still working because the story is still true.

So don't just \"post and ghost.\" Plan your launch. Activate your team. And make sure your investment pays off.

## The 30-Day Launch Calendar

Here's exactly when to distribute what:

**Week 1: Internal Launch**

- Day 1: Share with leadership team
- Day 2: Full company reveal (all-hands or email)
- Day 3: Send to employees with sharing instructions
- Day 4: Post behind-the-scenes content (production stills)
- Day 5: Monitor employee shares, engage with comments

**Week 2: Customer/Partner Launch**

- Day 8: Email to existing customers
- Day 9: Share in customer Facebook/LinkedIn groups
- Day 10: Send to strategic partners with co-marketing ask
- Day 11: LinkedIn native video post
- Day 12: First round of short-form clips (Instagram, TikTok)

**Week 3: Public Launch**

- Day 15: YouTube upload with SEO optimization
- Day 16: Website hero section goes live
- Day 17: Press release to local media
- Day 18: Paid promotion begins
- Day 19: Facebook/Instagram posts

**Week 4: Amplification**

- Day 22: Blog post with embedded video
- Day 23: Second wave of short clips
- Day 24: Sales team training on how to use video
- Day 25: Quote graphics start rolling out
- Day 26-30: Analyze data, adjust strategy

**The key:** Stagger your distribution. Don't blow your entire load on Day 1.

## Common Distribution Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Posting Once and Walking Away

**Wrong:** Upload to YouTube, post on LinkedIn once, done.

**Right:** Scheduled distribution across 30+ days, multiple platforms, varied formats.

### Mistake 2: No Call-to-Action

**Wrong:** Beautiful video with no next step.

**Right:** Every distribution channel has specific CTA (contact us, apply now, watch full story, download guide).

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Your Best Distributors

**Wrong:** Relying on company social accounts only.

**Right:** Empowering employees, partners, and featured customers to share from their personal accounts.

**Example:** When employees share video from personal LinkedIn:

- 10x more reach than company page
- Higher trust (personal endorsement)
- No ad spend required

**How to activate employee sharing:**

- Make it easy (provide copy, tags, links)
- Make it optional (never mandatory)
- Recognize sharers (thank them publicly)

## The Bottom Line

Distribution isn't an afterthought. It's half the battle.

The best video in the world gets zero ROI sitting on a hard drive.

Plan your distribution strategy _before_ you start filming. Know where it's going, who's sharing it, and how you'll measure success.

That $15,000 video becomes a $15 waste if nobody sees it.
