# Anatomy of an $8,000 Film: A Transparent Pricing Breakdown

_Documentary-style brand films that don't hide behind vague packages or "call for pricing."_

---

**Most video companies won't tell you this.**

Here's what an $8,000 documentary-style brand film actually costs to make:

**The total investment: $8,000**
**Our profit: $2,400 (30%)**
**Everything else: Direct costs to create your film**

Most companies hide this math behind "packages" and "investment levels." We don't. Here's exactly where your money goes—and why it's worth it.

## What $8,000 Actually Buys You

**Week 1-2: Discovery & Strategy ($1,600)**

_What you're paying for:_

- 8-12 hours of pre-production planning
- In-depth interviews with key stakeholders
- Location scouting and logistics
- Script development and storyboarding
- Equipment preparation and testing

_What you get:_

- A clear narrative direction
- Shot list tailored to your story
- Timeline and production schedule
- Risk assessment and contingency planning

**Why this matters:** Most "quick turn" videos skip this step. That's why they produce content that sounds like everyone else's.

**Week 3: Production Days ($2,400)**

_What you're paying for:_

- 2-3 days of professional filming
- Cinema-quality camera equipment (RED Komodo, professional lenses)
- Professional audio recording equipment
- Lighting and grip equipment
- Crew (director, camera operator, sound technician)

_What you get:_

- 8-12 hours of broadcast-quality footage
- Professional audio recording in every location
- Multiple camera angles for dynamic editing
- Backup footage for security and creative options

**Real cost breakdown:**

- Camera/equipment rental: $600/day × 3 days = $1,800
- Crew wages: $200/day × 3 people × 3 days = $1,800
- Travel/accommodation: $600
- **Total production costs: $4,200**

**Week 4-5: Post-Production ($3,200)**

_What you're paying for:_

- Professional editing (40-60 hours of work)
- Color grading with cinema-quality standards
- Professional audio mixing and sound design
- Music licensing (or original composition)
- Graphics, titles, and motion design
- Multiple revision rounds

_What you get:_

- Final film (8-15 minutes depending on scope)
- Social media cuts (30-second, 60-second versions)
- Graphics package for future use
- All raw footage and project files

**Detailed post-production costs:**

- Editor time: $50/hour × 50 hours = $2,500
- Color grading: $200
- Audio mixing: $200
- Music licensing: $300
- **Total post-production: $3,200**

**Business Operations ($800)**

- Project management and client communication

## How This Compares to the Market

**The "Cheap" Option: $2,000-$4,000**

_What you get:_

- 1-day shoot
- Basic editing
- Stock music
- 1 final video
- No discovery process
- Minimal audio quality

_What you don't get:_

- Strategic story development
- Professional audio in every environment

- Cinema-quality visuals
- Revisions that actually improve the film

**The "Premium" Option: $15,000-$25,000**

_What you pay for:_

- Brand-name recognition
- 5+ days of shooting
- Multiple crew members
- Extensive post-production timeline
- Custom music composition

_What you get that we don't provide:_

- 2-3x the production time

**Our sweet spot: $8,000-$15,000**

_What makes this work:_

- Efficient process without shortcuts
- Documentary-style efficiency
- Direct communication with decision-makers
- Equipment we own vs. rent
- Streamlined workflow from 65+ films

## The Hidden Costs Most Companies Don't Mention

### Time vs. Money

**Your time investment:**

- Discovery interviews: 4-6 hours
- Production days: 1-2 days (you'll be available for questions/approval)
- Review and feedback: 3-4 hours spread over the process

**Our time investment:**

- Discovery phase: 15-20 hours
- Production: 25-30 hours
- Post-production: 50-60 hours
- **Total: 90-110 hours of professional work**

### The Real Cost of "Free" Revisions

**Companies that include "unlimited revisions" are lying.**

Here's what unlimited revisions actually costs:

- Project timeline extends by 2-4 weeks
- Additional editing time: 10-20 hours
- **Actual cost: $500-$1,000 per revision round**

**Our approach:**

- 2 rounds of revisions included
- Changes focus on content, not endless tweaking
- Clear feedback deadlines keep projects on track
- **Result: Higher quality, faster delivery**

## What Makes Our Pricing Work

### 1. We Own Our Equipment

**Camera bodies:** $40,00 investment
**Lenses:** $25,000 investment  
**Audio equipment:** $15,000 investment
**Lighting/grip:** $10,000 investment

**Total equipment value: $90,000**

_What this means:_

- No rental markups (saves $1,500-$2,00 per project)
- Equipment we know intimately
- Immediate availability
- Maintenance built into project costs

### 2. Streamlined Workflow

**65+ films since 2019** means we've refined every step:

- **Discovery interviews** that actually uncover your story
- **Production planning** that maximizes efficiency
- **Post-production workflow** that maintains quality without waste
- **Client communication** that keeps projects moving

### 3. Documentary-Style Efficiency

**Traditional corporate video:**

- 5-8 days of shooting
- 8-12 weeks of post-production
- Multiple approval gates
- Extensive revision cycles

**Our documentary approach:**

- 2-3 days of shooting
- 2-3 weeks of post-production
- Streamlined approval process
- Focused revisions

## The Psychology of Video Pricing

### Why $8,000 Feels Expensive (But Isn't)

**You can't see the work.**

Unlike a physical product, video production feels abstract:

- You can't hold the footage
- You can't see the planning process
- You don't witness the post-production expertise

**Real comparison:**

**A professional website**: $5,000-$15,000

- 40-60 hours of design/development
- Content strategy and copywriting
- Photography and graphics
- Ongoing maintenance

**A professional brand film**: $8,000-$15,000

- 90-10 hours of professional work
- Story strategy and development
- Multi-day professional production
- Cinema-quality post-production

**The difference:** A website helps people find you. A film helps people care about you.

### The Cost of Choosing Cheap

**$4,000 video vs. $8,000 film:**

**Month 1:**

- $4,000 video gets 200 views, 2% engagement
- $8,000 film gets 2,00 views, 12% engagement

**Month 6:**

- $4,000 video: Still 200 views, forgotten content
- $8,000 film: 15,000+ views, 200+ shares, 15 qualified leads

**Year 1:**

- $4,000 video: Minimal impact, potential brand damage
- $8,00 film: Ongoing engagement, recruitment benefits, sales support

**The real cost of cheap video: Opportunity cost.**

**Extended Interview Access** (+$500-$1,000)

## The Value Beyond the Numbers

### What $8,000 Actually Gets You:

**Strategic Clarity**

- A story that makes sense to your audience
- Messaging that differentiates you from competitors
- Content that works across multiple platforms

**Professional Quality**

- Equipment and expertise that matches your brand standards

## Common Pricing Objections (And Why They're Wrong)

### "We can do it cheaper with our iPhone"

**You're absolutely right.** iPhone videos are cheaper.

**Here's what you won't get:**

- Professional audio quality
- Consistent visual quality across shots
- Strategic story development
- Post-production expertise
- Multiple platform-optimized cuts

**Real cost comparison:**

- iPhone video: $0-$500
- Coalbanks film: $8,000
- **Difference: $7,500**
- **Value difference: Immeasurable**

### "Our marketing agency can do it"

**Marketing agencies can definitely create videos.**

**Here's what they typically deliver:**

- Generic templates and approaches
- Basic editing skills
- Limited equipment access
- Marketing-focused storytelling vs. documentary-style narratives

**When agency video works:**

- Simple explainer videos
- Event coverage
- Internal communications

**When you need specialists:**

- Brand films that represent your company to the world
- Recruitment videos that attract quality candidates
- Investor presentations that build credibility
- Customer testimonials that drive sales

### "We don't have the budget right now"

**This is the most honest objection.**

**Here's our perspective:**

- Quality video is an investment, not an expense
- $8,000 spread over 12 months = $667/month
- Compare that to your monthly marketing budget
- Consider the ROI: 1 extra qualified lead = ROI achieved

**Our recommendation:**

- Start with your most important use case
- Scale up as you see results
- Prioritize quality over quantity

## The ROI Question

**How do you know if $8,000 is worth it?**

**Simple calculation:**

- **Current cost per lead:** $200
- **Coalbanks film cost:** $8,000
- **Number of qualified leads needed to break even:** 40
- **Timeframe:** 12 months
- **Leads per month needed:** 3.4

**If you need more than 3-4 qualified leads per year from video content, the math works.**

**Additional benefits:**

- Enhanced brand perception
- Improved employee morale
- Better recruitment outcomes
- Content for years, not months

## Making the Investment Decision

### Questions to Ask Yourself:

**About your current video content:**

- What's your current video completion rate?
- How many qualified leads came from your last video?
- What do employees think of your current brand materials?

**About your goals:**

- What would achieving your recruitment goals be worth?
- How much is closing one additional sale worth?
- What's the cost of missing your growth targets?

**About your brand:**

- How important is first impressions to your success?
- Do you want to look like everyone else or stand out?
- What message do you want to send to customers and employees?

### The Decision Framework:

**Choose Coalbanks if:**

- You need content that represents your company professionally
- You want to stand out from competitors using generic video
- You need results, not just content
- You value the story behind your brand

**Consider other options if:**

- You need simple explainer content only
- You have unlimited time to create content yourself
- Professional quality isn't important to your success
- You only need content for internal use
