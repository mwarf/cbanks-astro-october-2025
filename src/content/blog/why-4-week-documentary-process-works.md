_Documentary-style brand films that deliver faster without cutting corners._

---

**Most video companies take 8-12 weeks.**

They spend weeks in meetings, months in post-production, and endless cycles of revisions.

**We deliver in 4-6 weeks.**

Here's exactly why our documentary approach works better—and faster.

## The Problem with Traditional Video Timelines

### Traditional Corporate Video: 16-20 Weeks

**Week 1-2:** Initial meetings and brief development  
**Week 3-4:** Script writing and storyboarding  
**Week 5-6:** Equipment booking and scheduling  
**Week 7-9:** Production (spread across multiple days)  
**Week 10-15:** Post-production editing  
**Week 16-18:** Revisions and final approval  
**Week 19-20:** Final delivery

**Total: 4-5 months**

**The problems:**

- Endless meetings that don't add value
- Scripts that sound corporate instead of authentic
- Production stretched across too many days
- Post-production that prioritizes perfection over storytelling
- Revision cycles that go nowhere

### Our Documentary Approach: 4-6 Weeks

**Week 1:** Discovery and story development  
**Week 2:** Pre-production and planning  
**Week 3:** Production (2-3 focused days)  
**Week 4-5:** Post-production and first cut  
**Week 6:** Final revisions and delivery

**Total: 4-6 weeks**

## Why Documentary-Style is Faster

Documentary filmmakers work with constraints:

- Limited time with subjects
- Natural lighting and environments
- Authentic conversations over scripts
- Focus on truth over perfection

We bring these principles to corporate filmmaking:

- More authentic content in less time
- Professional quality without corporate stiffness
- Stories people want to watch
- Results that justify the investment

## What Makes Our Process Different

### 1. Story-First Discovery (Week 1)

**Instead of endless requirements meetings**, we spend 1-2 weeks discovering the real human story behind your brand.

**What this means:** We dig into your organization until we find the actual human moments that make people care.

**Real example:** For an energy company, we spent 90 minutes understanding not just their services, but their role in maintaining power during extreme weather. That became the heart of their story.

**Time investment:** 15-20 hours of professional work  
**Value delivered:** Story clarity and production efficiency

**Why discovery takes a full week:**

Traditional agencies ask: "What do you want to communicate?"

We ask different questions:

- "What customer problem keeps you up at night?"
- "Tell me about a time your product actually saved someone's ass."
- "What do your best employees say about working here that you never put in marketing?"

These conversations can't be rushed. A 30-minute kickoff call won't uncover the real story.

**Real discovery outcome:**

A manufacturing client requested a "company overview video." Generic. Boring.

During discovery, we learned their real differentiator: they'd never missed a delivery deadline in 23 years. Not once. Even during the 2013 flood that shut down half of Southern Alberta.

That became the story: not what they make, but their obsessive commitment to promises kept.

The video drove 47 qualified leads in 60 days. A "company overview" would have driven zero.

### 2. Efficient Pre-Production (Week 2)

**Good preparation prevents production problems.**

Our pre-production phase:

- Location scouting and logistics
- Interview preparation
- Equipment and crew coordination
- Final review and confirmation

**Time investment:** 10-15 hours  
**Value delivered:** Smooth production, professional results

### 3. Focused Production (Week 3)

**Documentary-style efficiency in action.**

**Instead of:**

- Multiple days of setup and breakdown
- Endless takes and retakes
- Corporate interview setups
- Artificial lighting and staging

**We do:**

- Focused 2-3 day intensive shoots
- Natural lighting and authentic environments
- Documentary interview techniques
- Efficient crew movement

**Results:**

- Higher quality footage in less time
- More authentic and engaging content
- Reduced disruption to your operations
- Better overall value

**Time investment:** 3 full days of production  
**Value delivered:** 12-18 hours of broadcast-quality footage

### 4. Story-Driven Post-Production (Weeks 4-5)

**Editing that serves the story, not perfection.**

**Instead of:**

- Endless revision cycles with no clear goals
- Technical perfection over narrative impact
- Over-editing that distracts from your story

**We do:**

- Clear revision process with specific goals
- Story-first editing approach
- Efficient feedback implementation

**Time investment:** 50-60 hours of professional editing  
**Value delivered:** Professional film with multiple platform options

**What actually happens in post-production:**

**Week 4, Days 1-2:** Review all footage (6-12 hours of raw material)

- Tag the best moments
- Identify story arc
- Select interview soundbites

**Week 4, Days 3-5:** Rough cut assembly

- Build narrative structure
- Cut interviews down to key points
- Add B-roll for visual interest
- Deliver rough cut for client feedback

**Week 5, Days 1-2:** Client review and feedback

- Stakeholders watch rough cut
- Provide consolidated feedback
- We clarify revision requests

**Week 5, Days 3-5:** Revisions and polish

- Implement feedback
- Color grading
- Audio mixing
- Final graphics and titles

**Week 6:** Final tweaks and delivery

- Last review cycle
- Export in multiple formats
- Deliver all assets

**Why this is faster than traditional agencies:**

We don't chase perfection. We chase impact.

Traditional editors will spend 8 hours adjusting color on one shot. We spend 8 hours making sure the story flows.

The result? Better engagement, faster delivery, same professional quality.

If issues arise, we provide open communication, additional revision rounds if needed, and commitment to making it right.

## The Hidden Cost of Slow Timelines

Let's talk about what you're actually losing when video takes 4-5 months:

**Missed Market Opportunities**

You need a recruitment video for spring hiring season. Traditional agency delivers in August. You missed your window.

**Stale Content**

Your industry changes. Competitors launch. Your messaging evolves. By the time the video arrives, it's already outdated.

**Momentum Loss**

Week 1: Team is excited
Week 8: Team is engaged
Week 16: Team forgot this project exists
Week 20: "Oh yeah, that video"

Momentum matters. Engagement matters. Long timelines kill both.

**Real Example: Time-Sensitive Opportunity**

An agriculture client needed a video for an industry trade show in 6 weeks. They'd already been turned down by three agencies ("we need 12-14 weeks minimum").

We delivered in 5 weeks:

- Week 1: Discovery and planning
- Week 2: Location scouting and interview prep
- Week 3: Production (2 days)
- Week 4-5: Edit and revisions

They screened the video at the trade show. It generated 67 qualified leads and $340,000 in new business.

A slower timeline would have meant missing the show entirely. Zero ROI.

## What "Fast" Doesn't Mean

Fast doesn't mean:

- ✗ Cutting corners on quality
- ✗ Skipping discovery
- ✗ Rushing through production
- ✗ Delivering something half-baked

Fast means:

- ✓ Focused, efficient process
- ✓ Clear decision-making
- ✓ No wasted time in meetings
- ✓ Experienced team that knows the workflow

We've done this 65+ times. We know exactly how long each phase takes and what actually matters.

## The Bottom Line

**Traditional video companies take 4-5 months.**

**We deliver professional films in 4-6 weeks.**

**The difference isn't shortcuts—it's efficiency.**

Documentary-style filmmaking delivers:

- Faster time-to-market
- More authentic content
- Better audience engagement (73% completion rate)
- Stronger business results

That's **90-110 hours of professional work** across 65+ refined films since 2019.
