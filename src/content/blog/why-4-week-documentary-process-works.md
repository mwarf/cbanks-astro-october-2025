_Documentary-style brand films that deliver faster without cutting corners._

---

**Most video companies take 8-12 weeks.**

They spend weeks in meetings, months in post-production, and endless cycles of revisions.

**We deliver in 4-6 weeks.**

Here's exactly why our documentary approach works better—and faster.

## The Problem with Traditional Video Timelines

### Traditional Corporate Video: 16-20 Weeks

**Week 1-2:** Initial meetings and brief development  
**Week 3-4:** Script writing and storyboarding  
**Week 5-6:** Equipment booking and scheduling  
**Week 7-9:** Production (spread across multiple days)  
**Week 10-15:** Post-production editing  
**Week 16-18:** Revisions and final approval  
**Week 19-20:** Final delivery  

**Total: 4-5 months**

**The problems:**

- Endless meetings that don't add value
- Scripts that sound corporate instead of authentic
- Production stretched across too many days
- Post-production that prioritizes perfection over storytelling
- Revision cycles that go nowhere

### Our Documentary Approach: 4-6 Weeks

**Week 1:** Discovery and story development  
**Week 2:** Pre-production and planning  
**Week 3:** Production (2-3 focused days)  
**Week 4-5:** Post-production and first cut  
**Week 6:** Final revisions and delivery  

**Total: 4-6 weeks**

## Why Documentary-Style is Faster

Documentary filmmakers work with constraints:

- Limited time with subjects
- Natural lighting and environments
- Authentic conversations over scripts
- Focus on truth over perfection

We bring these principles to corporate filmmaking:

- More authentic content in less time
- Professional quality without corporate stiffness
- Stories people want to watch
- Results that justify the investment

## What Makes Our Process Different

### 1. Story-First Discovery (Week 1)

**Instead of endless requirements meetings**, we spend 1-2 weeks discovering the real human story behind your brand.

**What this means:** We dig into your organization until we find the actual human moments that make people care.

**Real example:** For an energy company, we spent 90 minutes understanding not just their services, but their role in maintaining power during extreme weather. That became the heart of their story.

**Time investment:** 15-20 hours of professional work  
**Value delivered:** Story clarity and production efficiency

### 2. Efficient Pre-Production (Week 2)

**Good preparation prevents production problems.**

Our pre-production phase:

- Location scouting and logistics
- Interview preparation
- Equipment and crew coordination
- Final review and confirmation

**Time investment:** 10-15 hours  
**Value delivered:** Smooth production, professional results

### 3. Focused Production (Week 3)

**Documentary-style efficiency in action.**

**Instead of:**
- Multiple days of setup and breakdown
- Endless takes and retakes
- Corporate interview setups
- Artificial lighting and staging

**We do:**
- Focused 2-3 day intensive shoots
- Natural lighting and authentic environments
- Documentary interview techniques
- Efficient crew movement

**Results:**
- Higher quality footage in less time
- More authentic and engaging content
- Reduced disruption to your operations
- Better overall value

**Time investment:** 3 full days of production  
**Value delivered:** 12-18 hours of broadcast-quality footage

### 4. Story-Driven Post-Production (Weeks 4-5)

**Editing that serves the story, not perfection.**

**Instead of:**
- Endless revision cycles with no clear goals
- Technical perfection over narrative impact
- Over-editing that distracts from your story

**We do:**
- Clear revision process with specific goals
- Story-first editing approach
- Efficient feedback implementation

**Time investment:** 50-60 hours of professional editing  
**Value delivered:** Professional film with multiple platform options
