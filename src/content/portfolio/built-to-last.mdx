## The Challenge

IronClad Construction wanted a film that celebrated their 25th anniversary by showcasing their legacy of quality and reliability. They wanted something that felt substantial and "built to last," mirroring the structures they create.

## The Solution

We tracked the progress of a major municipal project over six months. We focused on the craftsmanship often hidden behind drywall—the precision of the structural steel, the complexity of the systems, and the pride of the tradespeople on site.

## The Result

The film has become a key part of IronClad's business development toolkit, helping them secure two major industrial contracts. It also served as a powerful internal piece, boosting employee morale and reinforcing the company's core values.
