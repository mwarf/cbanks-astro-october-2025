## The Challenge

Lethbridge Family Services needed to raise $50,000 for their winter community outreach program. They needed a way to communicate the depth of the need in Southern Alberta without exploiting the vulnerability of those they serve.

## The Solution

Our documentary approach emphasized dignity and resilience. We focused on the caseworkers and the community ecosystem rather than just the crisis. By telling the story of one family's journey toward stability, we made the impact of the donations concrete and emotional.

## The Result

The fundraising goal was surpassed within two weeks of the film's release, with a total of $72,000 raised. The film is now used as a cornerstone for donor relations and volunteer recruitment.
