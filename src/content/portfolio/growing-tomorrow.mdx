## The Challenge

Prairie AgTech was struggling to attract young talent to the agriculture sector. The common perception of farming as "low-tech" and "manual labor" was a major barrier for recruitment in their high-tech agronomy and data science departments.

## The Solution

We focused on the intersection of tradition and technology. By following two young agronomists in the field using drones, AI-driven soil analysis, and autonomous machinery, we showed that the future of farming is as sophisticated as any Silicon Valley tech hub.

## The Result

The recruitment campaign saw a 45% increase in applications from university graduates within the first month. The film was praised for humanizing the technology and making the agricultural sector feel relevant to a New Generation of workers.
