## The Challenge

Harnarayan Singh had a toy microphone as a kid.

He'd set it up in front of the television during Battle of Alberta games—Oilers versus Flames—and call the play-by-play to an empty living room in Brooks, Alberta.

He was told his dream was impossible. No one who looked like him was on television. No one in a turban called NHL games.

The Mosaic Institute named Singh their 2021 Peace Patron—their highest honour. Past recipients include Supreme Court justices, UN commissioners, and the head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Singh was the youngest. And the first from the sports world.

The assignment: produce a video that explains why a hockey broadcaster qualifies as a peace builder.

That's a hard sell. Peace work is supposed to look like diplomacy, policy reform, humanitarian aid. Not sports commentary. The video needed to reframe the entire conversation. It had to show that dismantling prejudice sometimes happens one broadcast at a time, not one treaty at a time.

And it had to work for multiple audiences. Young Sikh kids who needed a role model. Hockey fans who'd heard the "Bonino" call but didn't know the story behind it. Donors and stakeholders who needed to understand why the Mosaic Institute was pivoting into sports advocacy.

The tone was the tightrope. Singh's story involves racism, isolation, and systemic barriers. But it's also joyful. Triumphant. The video couldn't be a trauma narrative. It had to be a victory lap that acknowledged the road traveled.

## The Solution

We built the film around four movements: seed, wall, bridge, patron.

**Seed: The Toy Microphone**

The opening had to establish the impossible dream. A Sikh kid in Brooks, Alberta—a small prairie town an hour east of us—who didn't want to play hockey. He wanted to *call* it.

We shot aerials of the Brooks landscape. Flat. Vast. Endless horizon. The kind of place where difference is visible from miles away. The visuals established scale and isolation before Singh even appeared on screen.

Then the tight shot. Singh, direct to camera, talking about the microphone. The toy that became a totem. The object that held the dream when everyone else said it couldn't happen.

We didn't recreate it. We didn't need props or B-roll of a child actor. Singh's face, the memory in his voice, was enough. That's the documentary approach. Let the subject carry the weight.

**Wall: The Cost of Being First**

Singh describes himself as a "subject of curiosity" in childhood, which became bullying in middle school and overt racism in high school. Different language at home. Different food. Different music. And visible markers of faith—turban, bracelet—that marked him in a homogenous town.

We shot this section differently. Slower pacing. Longer pauses. We gave the words room to land.

The technical choice was sound design. We pulled the background noise down. No music. Just Singh's voice and silence. Silence makes people listen harder. It signals: this part matters.

We didn't dwell. We didn't make it exploitative. But we didn't skip it either. Because the wall is what makes the breakthrough meaningful.

**Bridge: Hockey as a Universal Language**

This is where the Mosaic Institute's thesis comes in. Singh's insight: "I really experienced the universal power of sport, where hockey brought us together."

Hockey wasn't just a game. It was the language that earned him citizenship in the schoolyard. Proof you could be Sikh and Canadian. Different and belonging.

We illustrated this with the career arc. The launch of Hockey Night in Canada: Punjabi Edition in 2008. The sacrifice—Singh initially paid for his own flights between Calgary and Toronto because the show had no budget. The grind of proving the concept.

Then the breakthrough. The "Bonino" call in 2016.

We used the archival audio. "Bonino! Bonino! Bonino! Nick Bonino!" The call that went viral. The call that made him a legend in Pittsburgh and introduced him to a non-Punjabi audience.

That moment mattered because it shattered the broadcast stereotype. Singh brought the energy of Latin American soccer commentary to the NHL. He proved diversity doesn't just add representation. It adds innovation. New styles. New energy.

Then the ultimate barrier: 2021. The same year as the Peace Patron Award. Singh became the first person of South Asian descent to call an NHL game in English play-by-play.

**Over 700 games.** That's how many he'd called by the time the award was announced. Seven hundred games in a language and a role that didn't exist for people like him when he started.

**Patron: Sevā and Service**

We closed with the Sikh concept of Sevā. Selfless service. Singh doesn't see his career as personal achievement. He sees it as service. Opening the door for the next kid who doesn't see themselves on screen.

We filmed him talking about his work with HEROS Hockey, mentoring at-risk youth. His role in the NHL's "Hockey is for Everyone" initiative. His ambassadorship for community programs.

The final shot was a visual callback. Wide aerial of the Alberta prairie. The same landscape from the opening. But now it doesn't feel isolating. It feels expansive. Room to grow. Room for everyone.

The colour grade was warm throughout. Golden hour tones. We wanted the story to feel hopeful, not heavy. Singh's journey is about resilience, and the visuals needed to reflect that.

**The Pandemic Production**

The shoot happened under COVID constraints, which created logistical puzzles. We couldn't do the large sit-down interview setup we'd normally use. Instead, we worked with smaller, safer crew configurations and leaned heavily on archival footage.

That constraint became an asset. The archival material—hockey clips, the Bonino call, news coverage—gave the film texture and variety. It wasn't just Singh talking to camera. It was a visual scrapbook of a barrier-breaking career.

We know Southern Alberta. We've shot in Brooks. We understand that landscape and what it represents. The cultural fluency mattered. Singh didn't have to explain what it felt like to grow up there. We already knew.

## The Result

The video premiered during the Peace Patron award ceremony and became a centerpiece of the Mosaic Institute's work in sports advocacy.

Board Chair Vahan Kololian framed it explicitly: "We are delighted to launch our work dismantling prejudice in sport by celebrating Harnarayan's instrumental role."

The video reframed the conversation. It proved that peace-building doesn't just happen in policy rooms. It happens in broadcast booths. In living rooms where kids watch Hockey Night in Canada and see someone who looks like them.

The timing amplified the impact. Singh's memoir, *One Game at a Time*, had just become a national bestseller. The book and the video worked together, creating a cultural moment where Singh's story broke beyond sports media into mainstream consciousness.

The Mosaic Institute used the video across their education platforms. It became a teaching tool in schools and community programs. The question it answered—"Why does representation matter?"—is abstract in a policy document. It's concrete when you see Singh's face and hear his story.

For us, the measure of success was simple. Did the video make you believe a toy microphone could change the world?

Because that's what happened. A kid in Brooks refused to accept "impossible." He kept the microphone. He learned the craft. He paid for his own flights. He called 700 games in a language that wasn't supposed to include him.

And now, somewhere, another kid is setting up a toy microphone. Calling a game to an empty room. Dreaming an impossible dream.

Except it's not impossible anymore. The door is open. Singh opened it.

That's what this project taught us.

Representation isn't a nice-to-have. It's infrastructure. It's the bridge that allows the next generation to cross. And sometimes, the most powerful peace work doesn't look like peace work at all.

Sometimes it looks like hockey. And a microphone. And a kid from Brooks who refused to take no for an answer.
