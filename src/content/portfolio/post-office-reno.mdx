## The Challenge

The most iconic building in Lethbridge was empty.

The J.D. Higinbotham Building. Five storeys. Copper-domed clock tower. Designed by Chief Architect David Ewart in 1913 as a federal monument. Walls faced with Manitoba Tyndall Stone embedded with fossilized marine life from millions of years ago.

It should have been the crown jewel of downtown. Instead, it was a fortress. Closed. Secure. Unapproachable.

By 2020, downtown Lethbridge was struggling. The iconic building that should have anchored the core had become a symbol of the problem. Vacancy. Decline. The perception that heritage was a liability, not an asset.

Sumus Property Group saw scarcity.

Managing Director Kendal Hachkowski put it simply: "When looking for real estate opportunities there is significant value in something non-replicable."

You can build a suburban office park anywhere. Cheap. Fast. Identical. But you can't build a 110-year-old Beaux-Arts fortress with a clock tower that's been keeping time since 1916. You can't manufacture stone walls embedded with prehistory.

The challenge was proving it.

Seventeen million dollars. The largest single private investment in downtown Lethbridge in nearly two decades. A renovation that had to honor a century of federal architecture while transforming a sealed building into an open, energized business hub.

Sumus needed to sell units—as commercial condos and leases—to a market that had written off downtown. They needed prospective tenants to see past the construction dust and believe that a 1913 building could outperform new construction.

They needed a video that could make 110 years of history feel like a competitive advantage, not a compromise.

## The Solution

We had one strategic insight: heritage isn't nostalgia. It's a moat.

Modern office space is a commodity. Lease rates compete on price per square foot. But The Post offered something no competitor could replicate. Our job was to make that scarcity visible.

**Filming Prehistory**

We started with the stone.

The exterior walls are Manitoba Tyndall Stone. Quarried limestone embedded with thousands of visible fossilized marine creatures. Crinoids. Cephalopods. Gastropods. Life from 450 million years ago, locked in the façade.

We shot extreme macro. Close-ups so tight you could see the individual fossils. The texture. The depth. The biological record pressed into the surface.

That footage became the thesis statement. You can't build this. You can't replicate millions of years. The stone isn't just a material choice—it's a 450-million-year competitive advantage.

The production challenge was lighting it. Stone is unforgiving. Too much light and it washes out, looking flat and grey. Too little and it reads as dingy.

We shot at golden hour. Low-angle sun raking across the surface, creating shadows in the fossils and relief in the carved details. We used polarizing filters to cut glare and enhance the texture. The stone had to look like what it is: monumental, rare, permanent.

**The Collision: 1913 Meets 2024**

The building is actually two buildings.

The 1913 Beaux-Arts original—ornate, symmetrical, powerful. And the 1958 modernist addition—a grey utilitarian box that wrapped around the jewel like an apology.

The architectural strategy was contrast, not camouflage.

The design team clad the 1958 section in black. Not to hide it. To frame it. The light Tyndall stone now reads as the centerpiece, bookended by dark modern wings. The building went from visual confusion to clear hierarchy.

We captured it with aerials. Drone shots from above showing the full geometry. The interplay of light and dark. Historic and modern. The footage proved the renovation didn't erase history. It organized it.

**"The Street": Punching Through the Fortress**

The building had been designed as a fortress. Two entrances—4th Avenue and 7th Street—that didn't connect. Segmented. Bureaucratic. Closed.

The intervention that changed everything: "The Street."

The design team punched a corridor through the heart of the building, connecting the two entrances. Suddenly, you could walk from the sidewalk, through the building, and out the other side. The fortress became a thoroughfare.

That single move—creating an internal public street—unlocked the entire redevelopment. It allowed the deep floor plates to be carved into smaller commercial units (down to 700 square feet) while keeping every tenant connected to the core. It forced collision between tenants, creating the "hub" energy Sumus wanted.

We filmed it as a journey. A continuous tracking shot. Starting on the exterior sidewalk. Moving through the new bronze-glazed entrance. Gliding down "The Street" past the tenant lounges, the boardrooms, the fitness studios. Out the far entrance.

The shot telegraphs the message without a word: This building is open.

**The Bronze Problem**

The most critical design choice was the least obvious: the color of the glass.

The new northeast entrance wraps the corner with glazing. It's the face of the renovation. Get it wrong—cold blue glass, reflective silver—and the building feels corporate. Sterile. Disconnected from its heritage.

The team chose bronze.

Warm. Glowing. The tone harmonizes with the Tyndall stone while providing modern transparency. At night, the bronze-lit entrance acts as a lantern, pulling people off the street into the hub.

We shot it at multiple times of day. Morning light casting bronze reflections onto the historic stone. Evening shots where the interior lights turn the entrance into a beacon. The footage proved the material choice wasn't arbitrary—it was the hinge between past and future.

**The Clock Tower Gamble**

The copper-domed clock tower has four faces. Custom-ordered from W.F. Evans & Sons in England in 1916. Belgian and Canadian stained glass. Each face 190 centimeters across.

Sumus replaced the analog mechanisms with Wi-Fi-enabled digital smart displays.

Purists hated it. But the decision was strategic. The analog clocks cost a fortune to maintain. The digital faces turn the tower into a dynamic tool—event graphics, public art, community messaging.

We featured it prominently. Aerials circling the tower. Close-ups of the digital face glowing at dusk. The message: we respected the form, but we upgraded the function. The tower isn't a museum piece. It's infrastructure.

**The Wind Problem**

Lethbridge is the fourth-windiest city in Canada.

Filming aerials of a downtown building means navigating unpredictable gusts funneled between structures. We've flown drones in -46°C wind chills on the prairies. We know how to hold a shot when the air won't cooperate.

For The Post, we needed smooth, cinematic orbits around the clock tower. Revealing shots that started wide on the downtown skyline and pushed in to show the bronze glazing details. In 40 km/h gusts, that's not a given.

We flew heavy. Used gimbal stabilization and flew in the early morning when the wind was calmest. The result: footage that feels effortless, even though every second was fought for.

**The Tenant Proof**

Architecture is theory. Tenants are proof.

Stantec—a global design and engineering firm—took Unit 230. For a company that designs sustainable infrastructure to choose an adaptive reuse project for their own office is validation.

Avison Young—the commercial real estate brokerage that listed the property—moved their own Lethbridge office into the building. The broker bought the product.

Teamworks Career Centre purchased the entire third floor. CEO Ryan Miller said it plainly: "If you need to go ahead and change your career or find work, just head downtown and come to this building."

We filmed the tenants in their spaces. Not empty spec suites. Occupied offices. People working at desks by oversized windows overlooking the intersection. The footage answered the skepticism: yes, this works.

## The Result

Seventeen million dollars. One hundred and ten years of history. The largest private investment in downtown Lethbridge in two decades.

The Post went from a closed federal building to a fully activated commercial hub. The second floor went from 40% leased to fully committed. The third floor sold outright to Teamworks. Stantec and Avison Young brought marquee credibility.

But the real result was the shift in the conversation.

For years, downtown Lethbridge had been written off. The Post flipped the script. It proved that heritage buildings weren't anchors—they were assets. That adaptive reuse could outcompete new construction on quality, not just nostalgia.

The City of Lethbridge's Targeted Redevelopment Incentive Program (TRIP) provided critical tax relief, de-risking the massive capital investment. The success of The Post validated the program and unlocked subsequent downtown projects. Other developers saw the proof and followed.

Urban Revitalization Manager Andrew Malcolm framed it: "To see private investment in the most iconic building in Lethbridge comes at an incredibly important time for us."

The video became the sales engine.

Prospective tenants could tour the building virtually. See the fossils embedded in the stone. Walk "The Street." Stand on the rooftop patio. The video collapsed the decision timeline. It answered objections before the first meeting.

Sumus reported that leasing conversations changed after prospects watched the video. The questions shifted from "Is this building viable?" to "Which unit is available?"

Kendal Hachkowski started using the footage in investor pitches for future projects. The Post became the flagship case study for the "non-replicable asset" thesis. A playbook for how to unlock value in heritage properties across Western Canada.

We know this because we're based in downtown Lethbridge. We watched The Post sit empty. We watched downtown struggle. And we watched this building transform into the proof that heritage can win.

That proximity mattered. We didn't need to be taught why the clock tower matters to Lethbridge. We grew up seeing it. We understood what was at stake.

That's what this project taught us.

You can't build scarcity. You can only recognize it, restore it, and make it visible.

One hundred and ten years is the moat. Fossilized marine life in the walls is the moat. A clock tower that's been the skyline anchor since 1916 is the moat.

The Post didn't compete with new construction on cost. It competed on time. On the fact that no developer, no matter how much capital they deploy, can compress 110 years into a construction schedule.

Our job was to make that advantage unmissable. To show the texture of prehistory in the stone. To capture the warmth of the bronze glazing turning the fortress into a lantern. To film "The Street" as proof that heritage and function aren't enemies—they're partners.

The Post isn't just a building. It's a 110-year head start.
