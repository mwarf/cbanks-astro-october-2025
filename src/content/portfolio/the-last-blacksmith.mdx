## The Challenge

Southern Alberta has a rich history of traditional trades, but many are fading into obscurity. Heritage Crafts wanted to document the life and work of one of the region's last working traditional blacksmiths to preserve this knowledge for future generations.

## The Solution

We spent two weeks in discovery, learning the rhythms of the forge and the philosophy behind the craft. We used cinema-quality cameras to capture the intricate dance of fire and steel, focusing on the sensory details—the ring of the anvil, the heat of the coals, and the steady breath of the bellows.

## The Result

The final 12-minute film achieved a 78% completion rate and was featured in several regional heritage festivals. More importantly, it sparked a renewed interest in traditional apprenticeships, leading to three new students for the Heritage Crafts foundation.
