## The Challenge

Crowsnest Coffee was launching their new "Ethical Origin" line and wanted to differentiate themselves in a crowded market. They needed to show, not just tell, that their commitment to fair trade and sustainability was genuine.

## The Solution

We documented the roasting process in their Crowsnest Pass facility, intercutting with footage and interviews from their partner co-ops in Central America. We highlighted the sensory experience of roasting—the sounds, the smells (conveyed through visuals), and the expertise involved.

## The Result

The "Ethical Origin" line sold out its first batch within two weeks of launch. The film's emphasis on transparency helped Crowsnest Coffee win a regional award for business ethics and sustainability.
