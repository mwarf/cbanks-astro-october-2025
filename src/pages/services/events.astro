// FAQ
const faqQuestions = [
  {
    question: "Can you provide same-day highlights?",
    answer: "Yes! For an additional fee, we can deliver a 60-90 second highlight reel on-site at the end of your event. This requires advance planning and typically works best for conferences or galas where we can set up a dedicated editing station. Full highlight reels (2-3 minutes) are typically delivered within 48 hours."
  },
  {
    question: "How many cameras do you recommend?",
    answer: "It depends on the event. Single-camera works well for small gatherings or simple stage coverage. Two cameras are ideal for conferences (one wide, one close-up). Three cameras provide comprehensive coverage for large events with multiple speakers, panel discussions, or audience reactions. We'll recommend the right setup during planning."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle live streaming?",
    answer: "We partner with specialized live streaming providers for events requiring real-time broadcast. We can coordinate the integration of our filming with live streaming services, or we can refer you to trusted partners for streaming-only coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if our event runs longer than expected?",
    answer: "We build buffer time into our scheduling. If your event runs significantly longer (more than 1 hour over), additional coverage time is billed hourly. We'll communicate proactively if we're approaching scheduled end time."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you capture attendee testimonials?",
    answer: "Absolutely! This works great for conferences and community events. We can set up a dedicated interview station during breaks or roam through networking sessions for casual testimonials. These add authentic perspective to the final edit."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should we book?",
    answer: "For major annual events (conferences, galas), book 2-3 months in advance to ensure availability. Smaller events can often be accommodated with 2-4 weeks notice. Peak seasons (spring and fall) fill up faster."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you travel for events outside Lethbridge?",
    answer: "Yes! We regularly cover events throughout Southern Alberta (Calgary, Medicine Hat, Cranbrook area). Travel fees apply for events outside our standard service area. Multi-day events may include accommodation costs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the final deliverables?",
    answer: "Depending on the package: highlight reel (2-7 minutes), social media cutdowns (30-60 seconds for Instagram/LinkedIn), and optional full session recordings. All files are delivered in web-optimized MP4 format, with RAW footage available in Full Coverage and Documentary packages."
