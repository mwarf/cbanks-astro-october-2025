// FAQ
const faqQuestions = [
  {
    question: "What should our team wear for headshots?",
    answer: "Wear what you'd typically wear to an important meeting or client presentation. Solid colors photograph well, avoid busy patterns or logos. We recommend bringing a couple of outfit options if you're unsure. We'll provide guidance on-site for best results."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a headshot session take?",
    answer: "Individual headshots typically take 5-10 minutes per person. For a team of 20, plan for about 2-3 hours total including setup. We work efficiently while ensuring everyone feels comfortable and looks their best."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you photograph our facility during working hours?",
    answer: "Yes! We're experienced working around active operations. We can capture your team in action without disrupting workflow. For manufacturing or industrial environments, we coordinate with your safety protocols and may schedule during slower production periods if needed."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your turnaround time?",
    answer: "Headshots are typically delivered within 24-48 hours. Half-day sessions within 1 week. Full-day productions within 1-2 weeks. Rush delivery is available for an additional fee if you have a specific deadline."
  },
  {
    question: "What usage rights do we get with the images?",
    answer: "All packages include full commercial usage rights for your organization. You can use the images on your website, social media, print materials, advertising, and internal communications without additional licensing fees."
  },
  {
    question: "Can photography be combined with video production?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We often integrate photography with our video production services. This is especially efficient for facility tours, product launches, or comprehensive brand content projects. We can shoot both photo and video on the same production day."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide hair and makeup services?",
    answer: "We don't provide hair and makeup directly, but we can arrange professional services for an additional fee if you're doing executive portraits or large team sessions where a consistent look is important."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if we need to reschedule?",
    answer: "We understand things come up. Reschedule at least 48 hours before the session at no charge. Last-minute cancellations (less than 48 hours) may incur a rescheduling fee depending on the package."
