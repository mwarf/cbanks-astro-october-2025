// FAQ
const faqQuestions = [
  {
    question: "What's the typical timeline for a brand documentary?",
    answer: "Our brand documentaries typically take 4-6 weeks from start to finish. This includes 1-2 weeks of discovery to find the real story, 2-3 days of production filming, and 2-3 weeks of post-production. Rush delivery is available for an additional fee if you have a hard deadline."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you find the story worth telling?",
    answer: "We spend time understanding your business, your values, and what makes you unique through interviews with key team members, research, and observation. We're looking for the authentic moments that resonate with your audience—not corporate talking points. The discovery phase is what sets our films apart from typical corporate videos."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the production process?",
    answer: "Every project includes comprehensive discovery sessions, professional filming with cinema cameras (RED, Sony FX series), multi-cam setups where appropriate, cinema-quality color grading, professional sound design and mix, and multiple rounds of revisions. You'll receive the finished film in multiple formats optimized for web, social media, and presentations."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide scripts or do we need to write them?",
    answer: "We don't use scripts in the traditional sense. Our documentary-style approach relies on authentic interviews and real moments. We develop a story outline and shot list during discovery, but the actual dialogue comes from genuine conversations with your team, not rehearsed scripts. This is what makes the films feel authentic."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our existing brand guidelines?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We'll review your brand guidelines during discovery and ensure the final film aligns with your visual identity, messaging, and tone. However, we'll also challenge you if we find opportunities to tell a more compelling story that might stretch beyond typical corporate constraints."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of results can I expect?",
    answer: "Our films average a 73% completion rate (versus 37% industry average) because they don't sound like marketing. Clients report increased recruitment applications, stronger investor interest, improved employee engagement, and better brand recognition. We can discuss specific KPIs and measurement strategies during the discovery call."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ongoing video production services?",
    answer: "Yes! Many clients start with a brand documentary and then engage us for ongoing content like quarterly updates, event coverage, or recruitment series. We offer retainer packages for clients who need regular video production throughout the year."
  },
  {
    question: "How many projects do you take on at once?",
    answer: "We limit ourselves to 12-15 projects per year to ensure quality. This means we typically book 2-3 months out during busy seasons (spring and fall). If you have a specific timeline, reach out early so we can plan accordingly."
